Hello and Welcometo the Cisco SD-WAN (Viptela) 4D On-Demand SE Foundational 
Training Series . My name is Andre’ Laurent and I am the WW Director of Engineering 
for Enterprise Networking Sales. This on-demand training is broken into various 
modules and can be used for independent training, as homework in preparation for 
virtual or live study group breakouts or as a guide to facilitate live boot camp 
redelivery. There are a number ofpeople that came together and worked above and 
beyond the call of duty to accelerate making this training offering available. WW EN 
Sales, The BE, Services, dCloud and the Viptela Team partnered from day 1 and were 
able to develop this training and associated demos in less than two months from the 
date of the internal acquisition announcement. This marks a major milestone in 
terms of training development and delivery.

We must stay focused on the target audience which is the Generalist SE responsible 
for presales. After quickly setting the tone and mapping to Digital Enterprise 
messaging and the pillars of Faster Innovation, Reduce Cost and Complexity and 
Lower Risk, we will transition into each area of focus and begin diving into technical 
details leveraging a 4D (Discover, Design, Demo, Defend) model. The session 
approach follows the typical PPDIOO and Top DownNetwork Design approaches 
starting with requirements and then leading into logical design before selecting 
hardware and software solution as well as associated licensing. 
Objective
We must avoid leading with a product/solution focus and the typical marketing or 
product/solution pitch. Also, product related technical detailed throw-up not related 
to design and operational impact results in an overall lack of relevancy and perceived 
complexity by our customers. Referencing Design Best Practices, Systems Engineers 
should be able to 4D (Discover, Design, Demo, Defend) to effectively position Cisco 
SD-WAN at a FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL upon completing this training. It is not possible 
to get toAdvanced and In Depthenablement over the course of a few days or weeks. 
We have included links to relevant information to support opportunities for 
additional learning at the end of each module. We are also offering ongoing virtual  
2

and on-location offerings for those who are interested in taking their enablement to 
the next level
As you can see, all sections are structured in a similar fashion and follow the 4D 
training series approach.
The modules between the opening and close follow a top downnetwork design 
approach. We start with non Ciscospecific Trends, Challenges, Benefits and key 
capability requirements. This section will not include any Cisco references including 
acronyms or product/solution information. We will then go into a sample customer 
discovery, use cases, buying triggers and insight sharing. This will then lead into high 
level design considerationsand we then follow this up with Cisco SD-WAN specific 
details. 
Let’s look at what a demonstration of capability would look like without 
understanding all ofthe product specific details of our solution. This will allow us to 
shift our focus away from delivering a product or solution transfer of information, 
which is more relevant when providing a training course and less relevant when 
initially showcasing how our innovation maps to customer key technical capability 
requirements. 
Having completed this, it is time for us to understand the Products, Software and 
other considerations such as licensing, as we will be leading our customer to a 
solution. Caveats are important to understand so that we don’t step on any land 
mines and set the wrong expectation with customers that could get them or us into 
trouble. The roadmap section will provide short term roadmap visibility to 
understand how we intend to address caveats with upcoming releases. What to Sell 
focuses on Cisco SD-WAN offerings and bundles that you may or may not be familiar 
with. 
When it comes to Measurement of overall Success associated with thistraining 
series, leadership will be looking at:
Demo utilization (Trackable with detailed metrics)
VoD consumption (Trackable with detailed metrics)
Comparisonsat a theater, geo, area, operation and team level (Trackable based on 
on-demand content utilization by others that were unable to attend boot camps, 
workshops and on location events) 
2

It is important to note that the trends, challenges, benefits and key capabilities 
module combined with the High LevelDesign Considerations module and the Cisco 
SD-WAN Architecture module followed by the demonstration of capability using the 
dCloud 4D Cisco SD-WAN demo, could be used effectively to conduct a one-to-many 
or on-on-one customer network engineering focused design workshop. In the past by 
partnering with Complete Communications we have also been able to show 
customers how easy it is for them to take advantage of free, no obligation assessment 
services to build a circuit related ROI. This design workshop approach has proven to 
be extremely effective in the past in terms of creating quantifiable pipeline 
generation and accelerated revenue conversion. Perhaps next time around we can 
not only beat the the 693 attendeecount, but also 56% unique customer request for 
a design session follow-up.

Although nothing is really all that new when it comes to the desired outcomes 
associated with digital transformation, one thing is clear:
We have entered into a new Era.
We are no longer concerned strictly with Connectivity. Based on the criticality of 
business applications, IT must provide a platform for Innnovation, Agility and one that 
does not compromise, but enhances Security.
We are no longer dealing with Human scale. We now have to consider IoT scale, 
which means considering people, devices and things such as wearable technology.
Customers are now looking at ways to not only virtualize network appliances, but also 
network functions.
Automation, Orchestration, Zero Touch provisioning and DevOps are now a necessity 
to deliver FastIT.
Most applications are moving to private and public clouds. Infrastructure as a Service  
4

offerings are becoming more widely adopted. Customers are taking advantage of 
hybrid models to reduce cost and complexity and to focus more on innovating faster.
We are now in the Digital Era 
4

Not only are customers evaluating there 5 phase plan for Digital Readiness, but so is 
Cisco. We are on the journey together. Customers are interested in moving from Best 
Effort to Self Driving networks and are focused on the most common attributes of:
- Automation
- Security
- Service Assurance
- And Analytics
Most customers are somewhere between the Manual and Semi-Automated phases of 
the journey. Most of the innovation you see coming from Cisco is closing the gap on 
Semi-Automated capabilities, while our focus is on accelerating innovation to achieve 
automated capabilities to address:
- Fully Dynamic Service Alignment
- End-to-End Cross Domain Automation
- And Fully integrated IT and business analytics
We are excited about the ability within the next 3-5 years to deliver on Self driving  
5

capabilities while we execute on our Digital Network Architecture framework.  
5

To get faster, customers need to simplify all the operations and configuration that 
have traditionally gone into networking. Software Defined Networking or SDN and 
controller capabilities are quickly becoming key areas of focus as they promise to 
evolve to a point where they can address requirements for Fast IT.
Think of the network like you would a car and look through history. In the past, 
putting together all of the pieces required human intervention.
We’d give people a bunch of routers, switches and other infrastructure components 
such as line cards, and they would have to build their own infrastructure and 
configurations.
Going forward, what businesses expect—and will need—is a solution that they can 
simply get in and drive. They need a solution that lets them go wherever they want to 
go and that addresses business needs right away. 
Traditional network management cannot provide sufficient dynamic management 
and address requirements for dynamic policy changes. Let’s face it, the focus has 
traditionally been on Day 0 / Day 1 automation and CLI was never designed to  
6

address volumes of changes in real time.
Controller based networking is required as it supports dynamic policy changes and 
allows the network to be managed as a system. With controller capabilities policy 
management is automated and abstracted.
This simplermodel allows customers to reduce OpEx while unlocking agility and 
empowers IT to be faster and more nimble. 
6

Successful architectures these days are simple and thrive on abstracting complexity to 
the upper layers, As you can see here that’s what Cisco’s Digital Network Architecture 
is all about. 
Cisco® Digital Network Architecture (DNA) provides an open, software-driven 
platform that integrates critical innovations in networking software, such as 
virtualization, automation, analytics, and cloud into one architecture. It gives 
customers a roadmap to digitization and helps enable businesses and IT to innovate 
faster, reduce cost and complexity, and lower risk with services that are easy to 
consume.
Throughthe course of this training series we will focus on the newest DNA innovation 
that recently came to use through acquisition, Viptela, which is now referred to as 
Cisco SD-WAN.  
7

Considering that the two transformative EN focus areas are SD-Access and 
SD-WAN, we have included a link to the SD-Access 4D On-Demand SE 
Foundational Training Series hosted on SalesConnect. We believe that you will 
find this additional training offering useful. 
8

This concludes the opening modulewhere we started off by covering the intended 
target audience, training format and expected outcomes associated with this Cisco 
SD-WAN 4D SE Foundational On-Demand Training Series. We then took a look at a 
sample Technical Decision Maker focused Network as a platform for Digital 
Transformation presentation. Considering that not everyone reviewing this training 
has participated in enablement activities associated with other DNA solution 
offerings, we included a link to the complimentary SD-Access 4D SE Foundational on-
demand training series.  We understand that reviewing on-demand content is simply 
the start of your learning journey and we look forward to your participation in 
complimentary virtual and on-location offerings. Thank you for watching. 
9

Some of you may befamiliar with what is meant by 4D while others may not. 4D is 
what you SE’s do everyday. You all go 4 Dimensional. How do you go 4 Dimensional? 
You do 4D’s and you do them very well. You Discover, you Design, you Demo and you 
Defend. This training is designed to ensure that you can 4D to map DNA solutions 
such as Cisco SD-WAN to customer desired capability requirements. We should keep 
our focus on helping customers to:
Reduce Cost and Complexity
Innovate Faster
And Lower Risk 
10

“Thebest teachers are those who show you where to look, but don’t tell you what to 
see.” 
We are going to take a slightly different approach to teaching and learning. Our goal is 
make sure that you can easily meet the required objectives of this training through 
practice and scrimmaging rather than by simply providing knowledge transfer or 
having you go through lab manuals focused on configuring things. Each module builds 
on top of the other with a focus on being able to get to a point where you can show a 
customer how our solution innovation maps to their key capability requirements that 
we uncovered during the discovery process. 
Let’s make sure that our time together is fun and that when it comes to Cisco SD-
WAN you are good at what you do and therefore love what you do. We are confident 
that this will result in a fly wheel type effect where we can come together as a 
community to accelerate learning for everyone.  
11

After you work with your account manager to qualify an account opportunity and do 
some business discovery, you find yourself having to go 4 Dimensional with the 
customer’s engineering staff. Your engagement typically starts with discoveryand you 
continue to perform discovery as more information becomes available. Part of the 
discovery process is sharing new insights to build credibility and to establish 
consensus. Discovery provides an opportunity for you to set the agenda early on by 
asking targeted questions and by sharing unique insights based on your vast 
experience and exposure, which is the result of having worked with so many different 
customers. 
We continue to set the agenda by working on a high leveldesign that addresses the 
challenges and benefits uncovered during the discovery process. 
As we validate and verify that the design meets the customer requirements and as 
we educate the customer on important considerations, it is critical that we 
demonstrate the capabilities to make them real. 
There are times when demoing capabilities is not enough and you will need to 
provide an opportunity for the customer to experience the value by either having  
12

them walk through a closed lab proof of value or by offering a prescriptive onsite 
proof of value. For certain accounts it may even be in our best interest to offer a 
custom onsite proof of value. 
It is important to make sure that the partner is engaged early on in thesales process 
and that we have a plan on how the professional services offering will need to be 
structured to execute on the vision that is being set during your selling motions. 
SLIDE  ANIMATION
We live in a very competitive world. The rules are changing. We need to be strategic 
and alsorecognize that it is time to take the gloves off and be proactive in beating the 
crap out of our competitors.

The following four slides are a take away reference and intended to provide some 
guidance in terms of what is expected with each of the 4D’s. Leverage this 
information as framework to create your own personal playbooks to ensure that each 
and every time you engage that you are engaging with relevancy. 
We will briefly cover the top four challenge questions for each of the 4Ds that should 
be top of mind.

16

This concludes the 4D Engagement –Training in Context module. As youcan see, we 
are shifting away from training that focuses simply on:
What solutions you need to sell and What products you need to know. Instead we are 
structuring this information in the context of what you need to be able to do as a SE 
at a foundational level.
Thank you for watching. 
17

Thetime has come to shift our focus to the most common trends, challenges, 
benefits and key technical capability requirements that are relevant to the WAN 
space. Focusing on these things from the beginning means that we will be leading to 
rather than leading with our solutions.  
18

Uponcompleting this moduleyou should be able to:
• Explain how current business and IT trends are having an impact on the 
evolution of WAN design 
• Describe the most common IT related WAN challenges
• Highlight the common desired benefits that are driving customers to redesign 
the WAN
• Set the agenda by sharing unique insights around the key technical capabilities 
that must be taken into consideration to avoid unforeseen cost, complication and 
downtime
• Map general technical capability requirements to the desired business benefits 
of Reduced Cost & Complexity and Lower Risk
• Explain the most typical and recommended SD-WAN migration approach

Automation and abstraction are core components of a Digital Network Architecture. 
Infact, at it’s most fundamental level, a ‘Digital Network’ is software driven with 
Open API’s instantiated on flexible and capable hardware to express business intent 
and to align network behavior to business objectives. In this optimized and 
automated approach to network service delivery a ‘Digital Network’ ensures bi-
directional communication, integrated security and optimal pathing. Customers 
interested in transforming their WAN environment to reduce cost and complexity 
while lowering risk aim to offer an uncompromised and secure experience over any 
connection.  
20

Let’s take a look at some of the most common trends that are having a considerable 
impact on the WAN.
Traditional networking infrastructure was deployed when the security perimeter was 
well defined, most applications were low bandwidth, and most content and 
applications resided in corporate data centers. Today, enterprises have very different 
requirements. High-bandwidth, real-time, and big-data applications are pushing 
capacity limits of the network. In some cases the majority of traffic is destined for the 
Internet or public cloud, and the security perimeter is fast disappearing due to BYOD, 
Cloud, and a dynamic B2B partner ecosystem. The downside risks of status quo are 
significant, and technological innovation has failed to comprehensively address the 
problem.
We are seeing a huge increase in the use Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a 
Service offerings . More and more applications are moving to the cloud every day. 
The adoption of solutions like Microsoft 365, Google Apps, Box, SFDC and other SaaS 
based productivity and business applications is not effectively addressed by historical 
designs taking advantage of centralized Internet capabilities out of one or more data  
21

centers. Why would anyone go around the block to get to their neighbors home when 
they could simply walk directly next door?
The number of mobile devices at the remote sites accessing these applications and 
accessing the Internet as a result of BYOD and Guest access services are increasing. 
The additional load of traffic resulting from all of these devices and devices 
introduced as a result of trends such IoTare guaranteed to put a strain on the 
network.
Video has finally become the new voice. Converging voice and data services was an 
interesting transition, but when it comes to video, today’s networks not only have to 
deal with optimized QoS handling for video applications, they need to address the 
needs of high bandwidth latency sensitive applications. This is going to require us to 
have to rethink capacity planning while looking for ways to maximize on investments 
by offloading certain types of traffic and by moving to active/active WAN deployment 
models. 
21

It’s no surprise that most customers are experiencingtremendous pressure on the 
WAN. Remote site users are complaining about poor application performance. When 
issues arise customers are finding that they don’t have the proper tools in place to 
expedite mean time to innocence. The network seems to always be the problem, but 
how can anyone be expected to confirm this when visibility and control are lacking? 
Making changes to the WAN infrastructure is not something that customers take 
lightly as the last thing any IT group wants to do is introduce additional challenges or 
risk to the business. Organizational structure and governance often results in 
controversy. Separation between infrastructure and SecOps teams often leads to 
debate when decisions need to be made regarding moving the Internet edge to the 
remote site edge and whether the risks are worth the reward. 
22

Designing and deploying the next generation WAN is about impact and the realization 
of some pretty obvious benefits. 
Often times we hear that customers want to augment or replace premium bandwidth 
services and move from active/standby models to active/active models. This alone 
will help them to reduce costs. The challenge is that augmentation of services can 
increase operational complexity and complexity is something that must be avoided as 
customer look to simplify IT and create a consistent operational model.
Ensuring remote site uptime to support business continuity is about more than 
simply protecting against blackout situations. Of course the network must be 
available to ensure access to critical applications, but I am confident that most of you 
would agree that critical applications impacted by conditions such as latency, jitter 
and loss rendering the applications unusable is just as bad as the applications being 
completely unavailable. Providing a consistent high quality application experience is 
top of mind. 
Not all applications are equal. For some customers voice and video are the most 
critical applications, while for others it’stheir point of sale system. Customers must  
23

have the flexibility and power to prioritize applications with granular control, to take 
back control of policy and this goes beyond optimizing QoS.
Many customers are still not comfortable with the Internet edge moving to their 
remote site edge to more effectively support the rollout public software as a service 
productivity applications or for optimized access to Infrastructure as a Service. 
However, these same customers are still interested in offloading guest traffic to 
directly attached remote site Internet connectivity as it doesn’t make sense to have 
this traffic consume precious WAN bandwidth by going through centralized Internet 
services.  
23

Traditional and legacy architectures cannot scale to address the changing needs of 
our customers. 
They are:
Expensive
as a result of being hardware centric with fixed capacity
They are:
Difficult to Support
Often times requiring box by box configurations or at best siloed management tools, 
and lacking any kind of automated provisioning
They are:
Poorly Integrated 
With conflicting policies and configurations between services making them inflexible, static, expensive 
and cumbersome to maintain which means that they are more prone to accidental interactions and  
24

vulnerabilities
They are:
Inflexible
Meaningthat they are tightly controlledas a result of being based on legacy client server modelsand 
historical vs predictive management models
Theyare:
Connectivity-Centric
Whereas an architecture for the new era needs to be application-centricand focused 
on the user experience   
24

The next generation SD-WAN solution needed to support today’s cloud-enabled 
enterprise needs to be complete and comprehensive. It should be built based on an 
enterprise-grade, software-defined approach. This requires a robust set of capabilities 
to reduce cost and complexity and to fuel agile IT. 
In terms of capabilities the solution should include:
• The separation of management plane, control plane and data plane to enable 
horizontal scaling
• Cloud hosted or on-Premise fully redundant management and control plane 
functions
• Accelerated branch turn up time lowered from days to minutes with zero touch 
provisioning
• Full segmentation support to enable a quicker and more secure deployment of 
business applications
• Per VPN deployment flexibility ranging from full-mesh, star, hub and spoke 
topologies to align to business and compliance needs with simple point and click 
functionality from a central location
• As well as Full network visibility and troubleshooting capabilities accessible from a  
25

single pane of glass
Thearchitectureshould bebuilt on time tested proven concepts suchasrouting, 
security, policy, operations, scale and automation.All of this should be packaged and 
delivered for the new digital era.
Not all solutions are created equal and enterprises must consider whether the 
solutions they are evaluating are designed specifically for enterprise migration to 
cloud and hybrid WAN, It is critical to look for flexible deployment options to suit 
business needs such as:
• Cloud based management
• Virtual or Physical secure routers for on-premise or cloud deployments
• In-house IT managed or Managed Services managed offerings supported byservice 
providers or system integrators
• Capex + annual subscription licenses or Enterprise based agreements to simplify 
consumption 
25

To truly support business continuityone must consider a number of different factors 
that could impact critical application SLAs. Some of these include:
• Link failures
• Equipment failures
• Bandwidth oversubscription
• Network health conditions and path MTU changes resulting in brownout situations
• The impact associated with not having the flexibility to deploy application aware 
topologies
• And finally cloud application latency which is hindered many organizations from 
realizing the value of Software as a Service offerings
Make sure to dive deep into each of these areas as you evaluate the best SD-WAN 
solution to address both your current and future business requirements. 
26

Traditional WAN infrastructure is not designed for the Cloud. As enterprises 
aggressively adopt SaaS applications like Office 365 and Public Cloud infrastructure 
like AWS and Azure, current network infrastructure poses major problems related to 
complexity and user experience. 
In order to effectively address cloud ready considerations, the SD-WAN solution must 
offer:
• Qualityof Experience for SaaS applications like Office 365 and Salesforce
• Scale required for direct branch-to-cloud connectivity
• Isolation and security for workloads across lines of business
• Interregional peering betweenworkloads across multiple regions and multiple 
cloud providers to support currentand future growth as well as flexibility
• Resilient access across multiple DMZs and multiple transports 
27

Ascustomers perform their due diligence and make their wish list, in the end they 
always seem to lead to a handful of common advanced requirements that must be 
addressed through some differentiated capabilities. These include:
• The need for End-to-end segmentation and the flexibility to apply this per VPN or 
per application specific topologies
• The ability to support a secure ubiquitous data plane. This means being able to 
securely connect different locations to one another directly through any end-to-
end IP transport path to mimic the ubiquitous data plane offering that they get 
when subscribing to services through a single MPLS provider. To further clarify, 
customers want anywhere-to-anywhere connectivitybetween sites regardless of 
differencesin transport types or providers. 
• Finally,customer are asking for security at Internet scale -Let’s look into this one 
further by focusing on service based traffic engineering  
28

Enabling Layer 4–7 network services like firewalls, load balancers and IPS in today’s 
enterprise networks is a complicated process that can take weeks or months. The 
delays are primarily associated with time taken for configuring the service 
infrastructure, determining the impact on upstream and downstream devices, and 
implementing change control. At the same time, the requirements for on-demand 
services have increased due to Cloud and mobility. The security perimeter at the 
enterprise is rapidly disappearing with adoption of cloud-based applications, mobility, 
and the requirement for ubiquitous access regardless of location. The traditional 
model of backhauling traffic to select DMZs and performing network services (e.g. 
firewall and IDP/IDS) within four-walls is inefficient and cost-prohibitive for most 
organizations. Delivering better user experience demands flexibility in deploying 
applications and network services anywhere. But two fundamental problems 
interfere with achieving this goal. 
The first problem is that the traditional network is designed for optimizing 
connectivity between the source and the destination. Network services are inserted 
along the path in an unstructured manner. As a result, complex policies need to be 
added on different routing devices in order to force traffic through the service cluster.  
29

The secondproblem is that network architects and designers must always make 
tradeoffs between the time required to enable new applications and the capacity 
required to optimize the performance of these applications. An example is that of 
public cloud / SaaS applications and BYOD that have introduced large scale shifts in 
capacity utilization of network services. This results in network services that are 
under built in some locations, and over built in the great majority of locations. When 
the CIO looks at the aggregate, the utilization numbers fall very short. 
To address these problemsthe SD-WAN solution should allownetwork services to be 
advertised easily across the network and allow packet flows to be influenced to 
redirect network traffic to the desired network servicesregardless of location.
Let’s take a look at a simple example.
<Animation 1>
Traffic from site A traverses the WAN to centralized services in the Data Center where 
traffic is either permitedor denidby the firewall. 
<Click>
<Animation 2>
We should be able to bring up a new regional Firewall and insert the firewall service 
into the overlay topology while maintaining security policy enforcement. 
<Animation 3>
This approach not only ensures that Data Center bandwidth is not wasted, but that 
multiple firewall services instances such as this can be deployed across key locations 
to address optimized connectivity and resiliency needs. 
29

Upon evaluating the relevant trends, challenges, benefits and key capability 
requirements, customer are convinced that they need to make a change in the WAN 
and that the cave man WAN of the old days will no longer cut it. What they are 
typically challenged with is how to approach migration. What is the best approach to 
go from the current state to the future desired state that includes:
• A ubiquitous data plane
• Transport independence
• Automatically secure routed endpoints
• Secure network segmentation
• Centralized policy enforcement 
• and the ability to advertise layer 4 to layer 7 services to the network
<Animate 1>
The roadmap to success that we have seen being used by many customers involves 
<Animate 2>
starting with the proper applications required to gain visibility. This will empower IT 
to: 
30

-Understand existing application traffic traffic patterns, consumption, markings and 
behavior
- Determine the effectiveness of existing QoS policies
- Evaluate the potential impact of proposed changes
<Animate 3>
This leads to the most difficult and feared step in the process, which is introducing 
transport independence. Introducing transport independence does not have to be 
scary or complex. One of the most common approaches we see is leveraging overlay 
capabilities through the existing equipment at the data center and even at the 
remote site in some cases. With this approach, customers typically just install new 
equipment behind existing equipment. If it is possible to replace the existing 
appliance at the edge of the remote site environment than this is done, but there are 
cases when the CE router in the branch location is SP managed and the service 
provider does not have a SD-WAN offering required to meet the needs of the 
business. There are also times when the connectivity on the old appliance is 
leveraging T1/E1 or multilinked capabilities that have not yet been able to be 
upgraded to Ethernet. Rather than investing in the T1/E1 cards for the new 
equipment to hard cut the edge equipment, the new appliance is installed behind the 
existing device which then performs basic routing functions at the edge. Once the 
overlay is up, cutting the branch is as simple as disconnecting the LAN interface off 
the old appliance and connecting it to the new appliance. All new connectivity such 
as secondary or tertiary MPLS, Internet services and 3G/4G are also connected to the 
new appliance. 
<Animate 4>
Independent overlays are created for each transport each one specifically designed to 
meet line of business, security and application topology requirements. This is when 
customers continue designing and optimizing for enhanced services delivery. They 
introduce per VPN or per application topology segmentation, tweak QoS and 
introduce service insertion.
<Animate 5>
Once the secure overlays and new routing adjacencies are up and optimized, 
customers begin selecting candidate applications to enable intelligent path control 
capabilities. They then continue to monitor link utilization, application experience 
and perform blackout and brownout failure testing. 
Through the process of cutting over remote site after remote site, customers 
optimize settings and create templates that can be used for consistent and simple 
provisioning.

In this module you learned that:
• The combination of app content, app delivery and app consumption is resulting 
in an evolving WAN situation
• Challenges such as poor application experiences, increased WAN services spend
and a lack of visibility and control are making it difficult for IT to provide the 
business with a platform to support faster innovation
• Most IT organizations are interested in realizing a common set of benefits such 
as consistent high quality user experiences, reduced cost, simplified operations 
and lower risk
• The journey to the next generation software defined WAN requires considering 
various technical capabilities such as transport independence, ubiquitous data 
plane, automatically secure routed endpoints, resiliency, application aware 
routing, cloud readiness, simple secure network segmentation, centralized policy 
enforcement and layer 4-7 flexible services insertion 
• Migrating to a software defined WAN does not need to be difficult as long asone 
follows the roadmap to success 
31

This concludes the Trends,Challenges, Benefits and Key Capabilitiesmodule. Thank 
you for watching.

In order to effectively lead with demo, to ensure customer relevancy and begin the 
design process, it is important that we first perform the proper discovery. We must 
understand what the primary motivations or challenges are that we are trying to 
satisfy. The best method of discovery is to start with basic questions, then work our 
way to sharing some specific use cases and customer stories while looking for 
customer buying triggers.
Discovery is not simply about asking questions. It is the opportunity to: 
• Set the agenda
• Gather and analyze information
• Share unique insights required to build credibility
• and an opportunity to broaden the conversation and to establish consensus
It’s important to remember, and we’ll see a reminder of this in a later module, that 
although we can cover a lot of ground and satisfy a lot of requirements, the 
capabilities and use cases we want to target are those that will have the most 
immediate and resonant impact. Focus and clarity of purpose during discovery will  
33

ensure any follow-on efforts are on-point.
Thismodule is focused on sample customer discovery output where we have asked 
targeted questions and have collected responses and other relevant data from the 
customer. 
The questions are intended to be used as a take away. Imagine asking these same 
types of questions to your customer and ask yourself, how would I respond to the 
customer in a way where I am either gathering more relevant information,providing 
unique insights, aligning to business needs or leading to a best practices design? 
33

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Ask relevant discovery questions and review potential responses to understand
what the primary motivations or challenges are that we are trying to satisfy and 
how these might potentially lead to a Cisco SD-WAN solution offering at a later 
point during the engagement lifecycle
• Identify challenges and opportunities present in current customer designs and 
deployments
• Identify ways to set the agenda by sharing specific SD-WAN relevant customer 
use cases without highlighting Cisco SD-WAN innovation, while leading to 
capabilities offered by Cisco SD-WAN
• Consider customer audience and identify buying and solution relevancy triggers

Read through these Q&As
The line of questioning used during discovery with a business stakeholder audience 
will be different than with IT. We are trying to get to the key care abouts and the why. 
We are also attempting to determine if the business recognizes the role IT plays in 
empowering the organization to realize digital transformation. The key is to focus the 
conversation around empowering the organization to innovate faster and lower risk 
while reducing cost and complexity. Get the conversation started and then to shut up 
and listen. Relevant use cases can also be referenced to share unique insights or to 
put further weight behind what is being communicated in terms of responses to 
questions. 
Let’s take a look at some sample questions that have been made available to you as a 
take away reference: 
35

Q. Do you consider security to be a strategic corporate objective? 
Q. Do you have specific compliance or regulatory mandates related to data 
protection?
Q. Are increased cost and complexity associated with implementing solutions focused 
on lowering risk preventing you from taking advantage of trends such as IoT/IoE or 
Cloud that could potentially help you to innovate faster? 
Q. Fast IT is a hot topic. Do you believe that your IT organization is agile enough and 
fast enough in terms of addressing your business needs? 
Q. Have you experienced any outages as a result of IT human error that impacted 
your business negatively?
Q. What keeps you up at night and how can IT help?

39

Let’s look carefully at this diagram for a minute to see if we can identify any 
opportunities or gaps in the overall customer design. Looks like the customer is spending 
a considerable amount of money on services and that they are Cisco shop. What 
additional questions would you ask or insights would you share based on the discovery 
output obtained so far and after having reviewed this diagram?
Do you see any single points of failure in the DC? Although they have redundant routers 
and redundant circuits, it appears from the diagram that they single link connected to a 
single switch. What type of switch is this? Is it a stack or a switch that has redundant 
supervisors and line cards? Why did they choose to not port-channel from the WAN edge 
routers to this distribution layer in the DC? 
How about the remote sites? Is all layer 3 routing for the remote site happening on the 
edge or is there layer 3 switching in place? How are they influencing path preference 
over the WAN? What is the convergence time? Have they encountered a situation where 
traffic didn’t failover and was getting blackholed in the provider network as a result of 
MPLS corruption and routes still being advertised by the provider? 
Asking questions like these helps to build credibility while learning more about the 
current setup. 
40

Considerhow some of the various common use cases effect different verticals. 
What is the impact of:
• Distributed media streaming with multicast
• Segmentation and per-segment topologies
• Service insertion and service chaining
• Virtualized elements for Cloud (IaaS+PaaS)
• Zero touch provisioning
When it comes to each vertical?
Dosupport and operations considerations have varying degrees of impact depending 
on vertical? 
41

Let’s take a closer look at vertical use case considerations for Retail and Healthcare.
Retailcustomers typically want to:
• Segment Point of Sale traffic to address security and compliance requirements
• Increased bandwidth and reduced cost while enabling in store services like Guest 
Wireless, Digital Signage, and IoT
• Eliminated downtime caused by network outages and at a minimum protect 
point of sale transactions
Healthcare customers typically want to:
• Migrate to cloud-based healthcare (EMR/EHR) applications to simplify and drive 
operational consistency
• Ensure 100% network uptime of patient and administrative services to protect 
lives
• Transition to Hybrid WAN for Active/Active utilization and application based path 
selection as poor performing applications could result in loss of life
• Achieve zero-touch IT capability while migrating the clinic footprint to the cloud
• Rapidly enable services like guest WiFi, and cloud-based VoIP and medicinal

Let’s take a closer look at vertical use case considerationsfor Manufacturing and 
Banking.
Manufacturing customers typically want to:
• IntroduceEnd-to-End Segmentation to address compartmentalized LOBs and 
dozens of isolated segments
• Secure controlled business partner access through the extranet 
Bankingcustomers typically want to:
• Provisionmore bandwidth at a lower cost resulting from a diverse pool of active-
active capacity.Of course security is top of mind when it comes to augmentation 
of WAN services.
• Defineapplication policies for optimal quality of experience and application 
aware routing to enabled in branch services such as Digital Signage, and Virtual 
Expert HD Video
• Rollout application aware topologies leveraging a zero-compromise secure fabric 
and ubiquitous encryption to address differences between ATM machine 
communications and branch-to-branch VoIP or Video

The procurement of information and communications technology (ICT) has changed 
radically in recent years because of the increasing popularity of cloud and other 
consumption-based services. 
The research shows that the cloud has helped businesses move away from the highly 
restrictive, conventional model of large capital expenditure (CapEx) cycles every three 
to five years. Today, companies can choose from a wide range of ICT products and 
services as well as financing and purchasing options. The growing influence of 
mobility, cloud, social media, and big data has produced a fundamental change in 
technology platforms. It has also altered how organizations and individuals adopt and 
adapt to this technology-centric way of life. Takea look at the key differences in on-
premise vs. cloud delivered solution consumption models and use these points to sell 
the customer on the value of cloud based management.  
45

There are times when discussingthe benefits of cloud delivered solutions when the 
customer will voice their objections or fail to understand the differentiated 
capabilities of one cloud provider over another. It is important to educate the 
customer that not all cloud delivered solutions are created equally and that it is 
worth taking the time to understand the finer points associated with:
• Security
• The impact traffic flows have on compliance
• Controller unavailability
• And Recovery
Make sure that you are setting the agenda and everyone is taking the same exam. 
46

When dealing with the customer IT operations team, it is important to see the world 
and communicate about the world through the eyes of each individual team member. 
IT Operations thinks in terms of Day 0 through Day 2 Operations. Tell them stories 
that bring them back to the themes  found under the Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2 
categories on this slide.
You might want to lead into the story by saying things like:
• Imagine if you could …
• What if you were able to …
• Would you benefit from having the ability to …
Let’s try it out. The first thing we need to do is share an insight and seed some 
objections. 
Many people are looking zero trust, secure zero touch activations, but have concerns. 
What if the device is shipped to the wrong location? What if it ends up with your  
47

competition or your neighbor? What do you do to ensure that you are not leaving the 
door wide open? 
Imagineif you could decide on the trust level for the device as part of the pre-
provisioningprocess,
What if you were able tostage a device in way that allowed you to work on the 
device by providing limitedcontrolconnectivity tosimply applydevice configurations
without enabling the data plan?
Would you benefit from having the ability to stage devices like this before moving 
them into production?  With full controlconnectivity into the deviceyou can apply 
whatever configuration and when ready flip the switchandpromote thedeviceinto 
the valid mode. That would then open upthe data connections and the device would 
become fully operationalallowing it to pass data. 
This is what most customers are after.
Take a break after this module and come up withsome of your own examples. Right
them down and share them with your peers and see what they think. 
47

It is important to focus on building a business case as you go through the engagement 
lifecycle with your customer. 
Will you be in a position to highlight:
• Reduced overall cost whether through an augmentation of services or as a result 
of removing complexity and simplifying operations?
How about:
• How increased agility results in improved customer and workforce experiences 
leading to an increase in revenue?
Will you be in a position to demonstrate:
• How the solution offering accelerates mean time to detection and repair in their 
environment to avoid expenses associated with prolonged downtime?
Have you considered how you will measure and report on:
• Improvements in performance and the overall application experience? 
48

Is there a business case that you can tie back to addressing security and compliance 
and how this was addressed leveraging application relevant topologies, segmentation 
and service chaining? 
48

Gather as much quantifiable data as you can on the current state so that you can 
continueto build on the business case by comparing and contrasting this to the 
future state numbers and percentages. Some areas of focus include:
• Circuit costs
• Time to enable new services
• Bandwidth
• Security and Compliance
• Change Control 
49

Ifyou are not currently working with a partner that is offering WAN services it is in 
your best interest to reach out to Blake Darling with Complete Communications to 
assist with a no cost, no obligation WAN services assessment. There have been many 
cases where partnering with Blake and his team have led to the creation of a pending 
event, accelerated the sale cycle and increased the deal size. Take some time to 
explore the story guide, sample demo VoD and Complete Communications Instant 
Dashboard Demo on dCloud.

Althoughyou represent presales, your customer expects that you will have some best 
practices recommendations associated with designing and deploying for impact. This 
module is focused on reviewing existing and next generation design considerations at 
a high level and will introduce the 4 Focus Areas and Supporting Technical Pillars for 
Reinventing the WAN.
Note: This module should be able to be presented as is to customer using PPT or 
easily converted into a white board based flow. 
53

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Review traditional WAN topologies and their constraints
• Explain the advantages and disadvantages of traditional WAN designs
• Highlight various WAN capabilities that introduce increased complexity
• Describe the 4 design and deploy for impact focus areas for reinventing the WAN 
and delivering a next generation business driven WAN infrastructure
• Describe the 4 primary technical pillars and sample capabilities that align to the 
4 focus areas for reinventing the WAN 
54

We should all be familiar with the common WAN topologies found in the majority of 
the networks out there today. These can be classified into redundant and non 
redundant options where redundancy in most cases results in increased complexity. 
Consider all of things one has to understand and plan for when simply dealing with 
redundant links:
• Administrative distance
• Filtering
• Summarization
• Traffic Engineering and path preference
Dual routers designs further complicates things by introducing: 
• Redistribution
• Advanced filtering techniques
• And the Potential for loops 
55

Each one of these remote site topology types has a Cisco Validated Design guide 
reference consisting of several hundreds of pages.  
55

There is noone size fits all solution and complexity continues to grow with scale and 
changing business requirements. 
Most network engineers consider QoS design and implementation to be one of the 
most complex things to get right. 
Whether leveraging VRF-Lite or full blown MPLS services, segmentation is typically 
difficult to setup and even more difficult to maintain. One is seldom able to find a 
single guide that explains what everyone needs to know in one place. 
56

Considering that we are no longer in the Era of Connectivity and Reliability and have entered into the 
the Era of Digital Transformation, we must continue moving along the five phase digital readiness plan 
to realize self driving capabilities.
This requires a shift from what we have been doing and a move from hardware and device centric 
options to open, extensible, software driven, programmable and cloud enabled capabilities.
We must have policy driven, automated and self-optimizing capabilities.
Closed-loop automated service assurance will empower us to transition to proactive and predictive 
solutions.

In this new era,Intent-based networking mustautomateroutine tasks by translating 
business intent into network configuration, freeing up network IT teams to drive 
more strategic initiatives with the business. 
57

A Business DrivenWAN Infrastructure can ease application deployment, but to make 
it a reality, we need to switch from a network topology to a service topology.
One of the biggest headaches for networking teams is supporting the rollout of new 
enterprise applications. Initially, the challenges were associated with data-center 
complexity, but increasingly they have shifted to the WAN.
That’s because the exploding use of the cloud for applications such as ERP and CRM is 
placing new and greater demands on the WAN, which isn’t well-suited to support 
many of those applications in its current incarnation. Ever since the WAN was 
transformed into an MPLS Layer 3 VPN infrastructure more than a decade ago, not 
much has changed. It generally lacks the flexible connectivity to keep up with growing 
cloud bandwidth requirements which makes it costly and difficult to provision new 
applications.
One of the biggest challenges to deploying new applications is lack of control over 
WAN services. In the current model, enterprises must rely on carriers to implement 
infrastructure changes for new applications and locations, which can take weeks or 
months. In addition, because there’s no way to instantiate VPNs independent of the 
underlying transport, implementing different service levels for individual applications 

is difficult, if not impossible.
<Animation 1>
Instead of relying exclusively on MPLS for transport, what enterprises need in order 
to make application rollouts easier is a hybrid WAN. For example, a single enterprise 
VPN infrastructure could encompass an MPLS Layer 3 VPN configuration, carrier 
Ethernet, and the Internet for transport, while providing coherent Transport
Independent Fabric and connectivity for all required applications. Since the Internet is 
ubiquitously available, it can serve as the core of the enterprise WAN and include 
branches of other types of transport, thus forming a complete infrastructure. This 
would allow enterprises to acquire services with different SLAs, based on application 
use and location.
<Animation2>
To make hybrid WANs a reality, we need connectivity that is based on service 
topology and can be centrally managed using policies. Currently, WAN connectivity is 
based on network topology and managed using a peer-to-peer model.
This means routing relationships are established by multiple control planes that 
operate independent of each other. Routing protocols like OSPF and BGP are used to 
establish site VPN routes and IPsec is used to secure the location. These routing and 
security control planes run independent of each other and have their own scaling, 
convergence and policies. Since most control planes are set up on a peer-to-peer 
basis, each requires its own policy and configuration. As a result, when a 
configuration change is required in the network, it has tobe provisioned and 
propagated across all the control plane peers, creating an operational nightmare.
Moving Forward we must transition from network to service-oriented WANs, the 
control plane must be decoupled from the physical topology. Today, control 
intelligence is discovered and processed independently by each and everynetwork 
element. By decoupling the control plane from networking nodeswe can gain the
following key benefits:
• Most computationally extensive calculations, such as best path, alternate paths, 
policies, and configurations are centralized
• The control plane can be provisioned as a virtual machine that can reside in either 
the data center or in the public or private cloud such as Amazon or Azure
• Deploy any type of data plane topology with limited control plane connections
• Incorporate security mechanisms using a Layer 3 VPN, creating a virtual machine 
firewall
• New site bring-ups only need to authenticate with a few controllers to get their  
58

connection policies rather than the extensive peer-by-peer adjacencies currently 
required
• Security services such as IPS, firewalls, and IDS no longer need to be in physical 
paths and can be on virtual paths, a critical benefit in the case of migrating to a 
virtual firewall appliance
<Animation 3>
The cloud is evolving into the largest VPN ever built. To support applications on this 
new infrastructure, we need a network that is capable of providingsecurity at 
Internet scale, that can support segmentation for lines of business, and that is 
decoupled from physical circuit-based topologies.
<Animation 4>
In the Eraof Digital Transformation, to truly design and deploy for impact, we will 
need simplified operations, enhanced monitoring and the ability to leverage analytics 
to gain unique insights into trends and behavior.  
58

The 4 Focus areas for reinventingthe WAN are:
• Secure Elastic Connectivity
• Cloud First
• Application Quality of Experience
• Agile Operations
These four focus areas align to 4 Supporting Technical pillars. 
59

The 4 supporting technicalpillars for reinventing the WAN are:
• Security
• Connectivity
• Application Services
• And Operations
We will explore each of these in depth as part of this training offering in the coming 
modules as we look to see how Cisco SD-WAN addresses each pillar., Let’s review 
each pillar at a high level to get a better understanding before diving into the Cisco 
SD-WAN solution and architecture overview. 
60

When considering the Reinventingthe WAN Security pillar, we quicklyrealize the 
importance in having a true end-to-end separation of control, data and management 
planes. 
• Devicesshould have embedded security
• The device authorization database should be centralized
• Encryption, PKI, segmentation and automatic access control should be ingrained 
within the system
• And the entire bring up process should be secure and leverage a zero trust model
• Data plane encryptionmust be robust and scalable
• While key management is light weight 
61

TheConnectivity Pillar should build on top of the Security pillar by integrating routing, 
security and policy for optimal connectivity. The solution should providethe ability to 
connecting multiple types of connectivity simultaneously and supporta provider and 
transport agnostic operational model. Horizontal and vertical scale shouldbe 
available across the layers to cater to various types of connectivity requirements –
today and in the future. 
Advanced segmentation capabilities and dynamic per VPN topology capabilities 
should be available to address line of business requirements.  
62

In terms of Application Services, the solution should supportfull application 
awareness across all elements in the systemand offer built-in optimization 
techniques for the networks and applications.
This network is fast evolving to be application aware so that it must choose the most 
optimal way to connect to IaaS / SaaS infrastructure. With a variety of constraints 
posed by SaaS providers (e.g. Microsoft Office 365, SFDC and Concur) and Cloud 
infrastructure providers (AWS and Azure), connecting into the cloud must deliver on 
resiliency, application experience, optimal access and security. 
63

When it comes to Operations, A network engineer must be able to define a network-
wide policy leveraging templates, rather than just a device-or node-level policy. The 
controller musthavethe ability to orchestrate the paths between the WAN edge 
routers, based on the centralized policy orchestration. As a business’ network 
requirements change and evolve, the policy shouldbe able to bechanged in one 
single place. Not only does this reduce the amount of time spent on configuration, 
but it lowers the likelihood of errors as well.
ProgrammaticAPIs should be available providing northbound access for automation 
and orchestration. Thereshould also be southbound integration for best-of-breed 
integration. 
64

In this module you learned to:
• Recognizetraditional WAN topologies and their constraints
• Explain the advantages and disadvantages of traditional WAN designs
• Highlight various WAN capabilities that introduce increased complexity
• Describe the 4 design and deploy for impact focus areas for reinventing the WAN 
and delivering a next generation business driven WAN infrastructure

4 focus areas for reinventing the WAN 
65

This concludes the High Level Design Considerations module. Thank you for watching. 
66

Top Down Network Designnever leads with hardware and backs into logical design 
and requirements. As you have gone 4 Dimensional and executed on the discovery, 
design, demo and defend phases of the engagement, we expect that you are in a 
position to make some solid product and solution recommendations. This module 
will cover Cisco SD-WAN Solution and Architecture specificinformation before getting 
into hardware, software and licensing specific details as well as caveats that will lead 
us into how caveats are addressed by roadmap items and what to sell. These things 
are covered in separate modules. 
67

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Explain and whiteboard the fundamental components that make up the Cisco 
SD-WAN solution
• Explain and whiteboard the role associated with each Cisco SD-WAN 
component including the devices that make up the secure extensible network 
fabric
• Explain the roles of various types of policies
• Explain and whiteboard basic example of fabric operation 
68

At the heart of thedigital transformation is Cisco SD-WAN, which lays foundation for 
connecting users, devices and things to the applications residing in private, public and 
hybrid cloud environments. Powered by Viptelatechnology, it is secure, scalable and 
open fabric, which caters to the variety of use cases around SD-WAN, cloud onRamp, 
IoTetc…It’s cloud delivered control, management and analytics elements can be 
easily consumed by the enterprises and they can also be offered as-a-service by the 
service providers. The high degree of automation allows zero touch operation 
without compromising on security or feature richness. 
69

CiscoSD-WAN architecture applies the principles of SDN onto the wide area network 
environment. By clearly separating control plane, data plane and management plane 
functions, Cisco SD-WAN fabric achieves high degree of modularity. Lets review in 
more detail the key elements of the Cisco SD-WAN solution.  
70

Cisco vBondorchestrator is a multitenant element of the Cisco SD-WAN fabric.It 
facilitates the mutual discovery of the control and management elements of the 
fabric by leveraging a zero-trust certificate-based white-listed model. It automatically 
distributes list of vSmartcontrollers and the vManagesystem to the vEdgerouters 
during the bring-up process. For situations where vSmartcontrollers, vManage
system or the vEdgerouters themselves are behind NAT, vBondorchestrator 
facilitates the function of NAT traversal, by allowing elements to learn their public 
(post-NAT) and private (pre-NAT) IP addresses. The discovery of public and private IP 
addresses allows establishing connectivity across public (Internet, 4G) and private 
(MPLS, point-to-point) WAN transports. vBondorchestrator itself should reside in the 
public IP space or reside on the private IP space with 1:1 NAT. 
When delivered as a cloud service, vSmartcontrollers are redundantly hosted in 
Viptelacloud. When deployed as an on-premsolution by the customer, it is the 
responsibility of the customer to provide adequate infrastructure resiliency.  
71

Ultimately, Cisco vManageprovides single pane of glass for Day0, Day1 and Day2
operations. Its multitenantweb-scale architecture caters to the needs of the 
enterprises and the service providers alike.
Some of it’skey functions include centralized provisioning, centralized policies and 
device configuration templates, ability to troubleshoot and monitor the entire 
environment and perform centralized software upgrades on all the fabric elements. 
vManageGUI allows segregated administrative access by implementing RBAC for 
proper roles and responsibilities. It’sprogrammatic interfaces enable DevOps 
operations. These interfaces can also be used to extract performance statistics 
collected from the entire fabric. Performance statistics can be exported into external 
systems or to Cisco vAnalyticstool for further processing and deeper insight.  
72

Cisco vSmartcontrollers are a scale-out control plane functions of the Cisco SD-WAN 
fabric. vSmartcontrollers facilitate fabric discovery by running the Overlay 
Management Protocol, the OMP, between themselves and between themselves and 
the vEdgerouters. Together with vEdgerouters, vSmartcontrollers act as a 
distribution system for the pertinent information required to establish the data plane 
connectivity directly between the vEdgerouters. This information includes service 
(LAN) side reachability, transport (WAN) side IP addressing, IPSecencryption keys, 
site identifiers and so on. vSmartcontrollers also distribute data plane and 
application aware routing policies to the vEdgerouters for enforcement. Control 
policies acting on the control plane information are locally enforced on the vSmart
controllers. These control plane policies can implement service chaining, various 
types of topologies and generally influence the flow of traffic across the fabric. 
The use of centralized control plane dramatically reduces the control plane load 
traditionally associated with building large scale IPSecnetworks, solving the n^2 
complexity problem. The vSmartcontrollers’ deployment model does not only solve 
the horizontal scale issue, but also provides high availability and resiliency. vSmart
controllers are often time deployed in geographically dispersed data centers to even 
further reduce the likelihood of control plane failure. When delivered as a cloud  
73

service, vSmartcontrollers are redundantly hosted in Viptelacloud. When deployed 
as an on-premsolution by the customer, it is the responsibility of the customer to 
provide adequate infrastructure resiliency.  
73

Cisco vEdgerouters are the data plane elements of the Cisco SD-WAN fabric. They are 
in essence WAN edge routers positioned everywhere SD-WAN fabric needs to be 
extended to. vEdgerouters are responsible for encrypting and decrypting application 
traffic between the sites. As mentioned earlier, vEdgerouters establish control plane 
relationship with vSmartcontroller to exchange pertinent information required to 
establish the fabric and learn centrally provisioned policies. Data plane and 
application aware routing policies are implemented on the vEdgerouters. vEdge
routers export performance statistics, as well as alerts and events to centralized 
vManagesystem for a single pane of glass operations.
vEdgerouters leverage standards based OSPF and BGP routing protocols for learning 
reachability information from service (LAN) side interfaces and for brownfield 
integration with non-SDWAN sites. vEdgerouters have very mature full-stack routing 
implementation, which accommodates simple, moderate and complex routed 
environments. For Layer2 redundant service (LAN) side interfaces, vEdgerouters 
implement VRRP first-hop redundancy protocol, which can operate on a per-VLAN 
basis.
vEdgerouters can be brought on-line in a full zero touch deployment fashion or by  
74

requiring administrative approval. Zero touch deployment relies on the use of signed 
certificates installed in the on-board temper proof module, the TPM) to establish 
unique router identity.
Finally, vEdgerouters are delivered in both physical or virtual form factors. Physical 
form factors are deployed as appliances with either 100Mb, 1Gb or 10Gb based on 
the throughput needs. The virtual form factor can be deployed in public clouds, such 
as AWS and Microsoft Azure or as an NFV on the vCPE/uCPEplatforms leveraging 
KVM or ESXihypervisors.  
74

Overlay Management Protocol, the OMP, lies in the heart of the Cisco SD-WAN fabric. 
It is TCP based highly extensible control plane protocol that unifies all control plane 
functions under the single protocol umbrella. It operates inside bi-directionally 
certificate authenticated TLS or DTLS connections established between the vSmart
controllers and between the vSmartcontrollers and the vEdgerouters. By leveraging 
the concepts of address families and route attributes, OMP advertises all pertinent 
control plane information between the vEdgerouters to allow establishing direct 
IPSeccommunication between the vEdgerouters without reliance on IKE protocol. It 
allows exchange of full reachability without reliance on traditional routing protocols, 
such as OSPF and BGP, over the IPSectunnels. Furthermore, OMP allows dissimilation 
of centrally (on vManage) defined data and application aware routing policies for a 
fully distributed scale-out enforcement on the vEdgerouters.
Ultimately, OMP allows high degree of scalability by dramatically lowering control 
plane complexity and eliminating the n^2 problem associated with traditional IKE 
based IPSecnetworks. As depicted by the diagram at the bottom of the slide, the use 
of OMP and vSmartcontrollers creates linear complexity control plane where vEdge
routers establish control plane connectivity only to a handful of vSmartcontrollers 
and not to every other vEdgerouter in the topology. In contrast, in traditional IKE  
75

based IPSecnetworks, each router needs to establish control plane connection to 
every other router in the topology, resulting in quadratic n^2 control plane 
complexity that does not scale.   
75

To understand the basic Cisco SD-WAN fabric operation, lets look at this simple 
example. Lets consider a starting point where vSmartcontrollers had been brought 
online and two vEdgerouters, one at each remote site, are trying to connect as part 
of a zero touch bring-up process. As described earlier, a bi-directional certificate 
exchange will happen between the vEdgerouters and the vSmartcontroller where 
both parties will authenticate and authorize each other. vEdgeidentity is based on 
the signed certificate inside the on-board TMP module inserted during the time of 
manufacturing, vSmartidentity is based on the Enterprise or public PKI signed 
certificate loaded during the vSmartcontroller deployment phase. Subsequent to the 
successful bi-directional authentication and authorization, a TLS or DTLS connection 
will come up between the vEdgerouters and the vSmartcontroller. OMP protocol will 
establish peering across the TLS/DTLS connections between the vEdgerouters and 
the vSmartcontroller and following the OMP advertisements, IPSecconnection will 
automatically come up. Once IPSecconnections are established each vEdgerouter 
will initiate BFD probing mechanism across the IPSecconnection to determine 
up/down state, loss, latency, jitter and maximum path MTU. 
The next step is to determine reachability for the local service side networks behind 
each vEdhgerouter. Each vEdgerouter will use local mechanisms to determine its  
76

local networks, which can be directly connected subnets, statically defined subnets or 
dynamically learned subnets through OSPF or BGP. vEdgerouter will place the learnt 
subnets into the relevant VPN based on the inbound service (LAN) side interface or 
sub-interface (in case of 802.1q tags) and advertise the reachability to the vSmart
controller using OMP update message. vSmartcontroller will in turn pass this 
advertisement to the other vEdgerouter in the topology. Same process will occur for 
the other vEdgerouter and bi-directional connectivity between service (LAN) side 
subnets will be established. 
As new subnets or new VPNs become part of the fabric, the same process will 
continue. If implementation includes data or application aware routing policies, such 
policies will be communicated to the relevant vEdgerouters in OMP updates for 
distributed enforcement. In case of control polices, they will be enforced on the 
vSmartcontroller and will not be communicated to the vEdgerouters.  
76

77

Finally, as motioned earlier in this chapter,vManagesystem provides a single pane of 
glass for all operational tasks performed on the fabric. It’s GUI is built upon the REST 
APIs exposed by the vManageserver. vManagecan be deployed as a single server 
solution or as a clustered solution for higher scale and redundancy. An optional layer 
of analytics can be added to provide deeper insight into the fabric utilization trends, 
capacity projections, applications quality of experience and a variety of other data.

82

Cisco SD-WAN fabric incorporates zero-trust security model where all elements of the 
fabric must be authenticated and authorized prior to be admitted to the network. 
This model is predicated on the use of signed certificates to establish the identity of 
each fabric element. Letslook first at the identity of the vEdgerouters.
PhysialvEdgerouter is equipped with on-board temper proof module, the TPM. At 
the time of manufacturing a certificate signed by Avnet root CA is installed in the TPM 
module. TPM module is read-only, which creates persistent vEdgerouter identity 
throughout the lifetime of the router. This certificate is presented to the controllers 
during initial vEdgerouter authentication and authorization process. vEdgerouter 
software also by default includes certificate for the Symantec root CA. This certificate 
is used to authenticate the identity of controllers (vBond, vSmartand vManage). If it 
is desired to use Enterprise CA instead of Symantec CA for signing controllers’ 
certificates, Enterprise root CA certificate must be loaded into all vEdgerouters (and 
the controllers). Loading of Enterprise root CA certificate onto the vEdgerouters can 
be automated during the ZTP process. 
In case of the vEdgecloud, it does not have a TPM chip, so a different mechanism is 
needed. In this case vManageacts as a root CA server, allocated self-signed  
83

certificates to the vEdgeCloud routers, following the validation of one time
authentication password (OTP). Since physical and virtual vEdgerouters run the same 
software, vEdgeCloud includes the certificate for the Symantec root CA in order to 
validate the certificate presented by the controllers. If it is desired to use Enterprise 
CA instead of Symantec CA for signing controllers’ certificate, Enterprise root CA 
certificate must be loaded into all vEdgerouters (and the controllers). Loading of 
Enterprise root CA certificate only the vEdgeCloud router can be automated as part 
of cloud-initdeployment process.  
83

Controllersby default use Symantec signed certificatesto establish their identity. As
mentioned earlier, if desired it is possible to use Enterprise CA for that. Symantec root 
CA certificate is used to authenticate (establish trust) other controllers in the fabric. 
Avnet root CA certificate is used to authenticate (establish trust) physical vEdge
routers and vManageroot CA certificate is used to authenticate (establish trust) 
vEdgeCloud routers. 
84

Once identities ofall data, control and management plane elementshad been 
established through the use of certificates,the next step is to authorize their 
operation in the fabric by creating a white-list. vBondorchestrators and vSmart
controllers are defined by the administrator in the vManageGUI, while the list of 
authorized vEdgerouters, both physical and virtual, are uploaded as a signed vEdge
list.
vManagepropagates the list of vEdgerouters and all the controllers to vBond
orchestrators and vSmartcontrollers, so the fabric can fully establish. 
85

Building on the principles of zero-trust, vEdgerouters provide effective barrier to 
prevent denial of service attacks against the infrastructure. vEdgerouters are locked 
down appliances that run on a hardened Linux operating system. Transport (WAN) 
side interfaces are automatically enabled with strong protection to prevent any 
unauthorized communication to and through the device. Before any of the fabric 
elements are discovered, vEdgerouter’s transport side interfaces allow only a handful 
of traffic, primarily needed to establish basic service provider connectivity, such as 
getting IP address through DHCP, allowing DNS queries for the zero touch deployment 
or checking connectivity liveliness with ICMP. Other types of connectivity, such as 
SSH, NETCONF, NTP and dynamic routing protocols can be manually enabled, but they 
are disabled by default.
As the vEdgerouter reaches out to controllers and establishes TLS/DTLS connection, 
it automatically adjusts the kernel level filters to allow this traffic back into the router. 
Only authorized controllers are allowed to communicate back to the vEdgerouter. 
Similar process occurs with remote vEdgerouters. Once local vEdgerouter learns 
about remote vEdgerouters through OMP, it adjusts its kernel level protection to 
allow building IPSectunnel (UDP encapsulated). Since those remote vEdgerouters 
had undergone the same authentication and authorization process as the local vEdge 
86

router, they are trusted entities on the fabric. 
In case of services, such as cloud security, the sources of transmission are explicitly 
defined by the administrator in configuration template attached to the vEdgerouter 
and as such they can be trusted. Lastly, in case of direct Internet access, the only 
traffic allowed back is the traffic matching the NAT table entries on the vEdgerouter, 
which were created as a result of communication initiated from within the trusted 
service (LAN) side of the vEdgerouter.
All other types of traffic are denied by the vEdgerouter. vEdgerouter provides special 
protection for its CPU by applying control plane policing and rate limiting the amount 
of traffic that is allowed to be punted to the CPU. 
86

Very similarly to the vEdgerouters, all controllersprovide protection for mitigating 
denial of service attacks against the infrastructure. TLS/DTLS communication from 
other controllers is only allowed after they had been properly authenticated and 
authorized. The same occurs with the traffic arriving from vEdgerouters. Controllers 
allow certain types of traffic in order to establish connectivity, such as DHCP and DNS, 
and to check for liveliness with ICMP. NETCONF is allowed for initial communication 
with the vManagesystem. 
87

Dataplane communication across the Cisco SD-WAN fabric consists of IPSec
encrypted tunnels between the vEdgerouters. vEdgerouters leverage AES-GCM 
encryption with 256-bit encryption keys. In orderto ensure data privacy, vEdge
routers must establish a mechanism for IPSecencryption key rotation. Each vEdge
router in the topology derives a per-transport key for all the transports it’s connected 
to. These keys are communicated to other vEdgerouters through the OMP protocol 
as an attribute of the transport locator, the TLOC, route. All remote vEdgerouters will 
use the advertised key to encrypt the traffic toward the originating vEdgerouter using 
different encryption key per-transport.
Key rotation can be done very rapidly without control plane churn by leveraging OMP 
updates. This effective mechanism for key rotation keeps traffic highly secure and 
effectively mitigates any eavesdropping attacks in attempt to decrypt traffic and gain 
access to the original application data.  
88

Man-in-themiddle attacks are very common methods of capturing encrypted traffic 
in attempt to decrypt it and gain access to the original application data. In the 
previous slide we discussed how rapid key rotation can be effective means of 
mitigating attacks like that, however, Cisco SD-WAN fabric provides additional method 
of circumventing these attacks by leveraging Authentication Header to prevent 
tempering with outer IP header addressing. In the traditional IPSecnetworks, the use 
of Authentication Header was greatly challenged by the NAT traversal, which 
modified outer IP header addressing invalidating AH hash and subsequently causing 
packet drop. 
Cisco SD-WAN allows leveraging Authentication Header even when NAT is in place. 
This is achieved by leveraging vBondintelligence to discover public (post-NAT) IP 
address of the vEdgerouter. vBondcommunicates this public IP address back to the 
vEdgerouter, which uses it to precompute Authentication Header hash based on the 
eventual source IP address of the packet once it passes through the NAT.
This approach prevents packet drop resulting from invalid Authentication Header 
hash and greatly helps in mitigating man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. 
89

Virtual Private Networks are very effective tool in Cisco SD-WAN solution in order to 
create segmentation in otherwise flat wide area networks. Even in cases of VPN 
capable transports, such as MPLS, the use Cisco SD-WAN VPNs allows extending the 
advantages of traffic segmentation to transports not natively supporting it, such as 
Internet or 4G LTE.
VPNs are defined on the vEdgerouters as part of the configuration templates. Once 
defined, vEdgerouters communicate to vSmartcontrollers their interest in a specific 
VPN, at which point vSmartcontrollers send down all relevant reachability 
information associated with this VPN. vEdgerouters do not receive OMP updates in 
regard to VPNs, which they had not been configured for. This approach instantly 
creates end-to-end segmentation across the fabric. 
vEdgerouters identify three types of VPNs. VPN0 is reserved for transport (WAN) 
type connectivity. VPN512 is reserved for out-of-band management. VPNs 1-511 can 
be used as service (LAN) side VPNs. VPN membership is determined on an interface 
or sub-interface level (if 802.1q tags are used). 
Segmentation caters to a several use cases, such security zoning, compliance,  
90

extranets and a form of multitenancy. 
90

If we take a closer look, in the data planesegmentation is delivered by multiplexing
traffic belonging to different VPNs inside a common IPSectunnel between the vEdge
routers. Labels are used to identify the VPN the packet belongs to. VPN labels are 
placed in the encrypted payload of the packet and they are not visible in clear text. 
Ingress vEdgerouters apply VPN labels before performing IPSecencryption, egress 
vEdgerouters use VPN labels to perform lookup in the appropriate VPN routing table 
after the packet had been decrypted. VPN labels are exchanged between the ingress 
and egress vEdgerouters as the OMP route attributes.  
91

So far we hadtalked about securing the infrastructure by mitigating denial of service 
attacks, providing data privacy and data integrity for the IPSecencrypted application 
traffic, and using VPNs for segmentation. Lets now talk about security services that 
can be provided to an actual application traffic by establishing local and/or regional 
secure perimeters.
Local secure perimeter is defined as an application traffic security inspection point 
delivered at the branch office, closest to the user population. Several models of such 
security inspection points exist, but the two most noticeable ones are using L4-L7 
security appliances, mainly Firewalls and IDS/IPS appliances, installed in front of the 
vEdgerouters at the branch office and leveraging inherent Cisco SD-WAN fabric 
firewalling capabilities. When L4-L7 appliances are leveraged, they deliver stateful
inspection based on vendor appliance capabilities. vEdgerouters at the branch office 
can enforce centrally defined policies blocking or allowing application traffic based on 
L3, L4 and L7 DPI matching in a given VPN.
Both vEdgerouters and the L4-L7 security appliances can be delivered in a physical or 
virtual form factor for the desired deployment and operational model. 
92

Alternative to thelocal secure perimeter is the regional secure perimeter. With 
regional secure perimeter, vEdgerouters at the remote offices forward application 
traffic of interest in a VPN of choice toward the regional data centers or the regional 
hub sites where it is handed over to the local L4-L7 services for security policy 
inspection. If the policy inspection results in allow action, application traffic is 
forwarded back to the vEdgerouter at the regional site, which uses its forwarding 
table to send the traffic to its final destination. 
Traffic steering can be implemented through data policies if the match criteria relies 
on TCP/IP header fields (source/destination IP addresses, source/destination 
TCP/UDP ports) or the DPI signature matching. Traffic steering can be implemented 
through the control policies if the match criteria relies on any of the fields advertised 
through OMP, such as destination prefixes or site IDs.
Service insertion framework can insert any L4-L7 service, most commonly Firewalls 
and IDS/IPS appliances. It is also possible to subject application traffic to multiple L4-
L7 services connected in the same or different regional facilities through a service 
chain. Service chain can also be orchestrated though the vManagepolicies.  
93

Many organizations have cloud-first strategy, where compute resources are being 
aggressively migrated from on-premdata centers to the cloud service providers, like 
AWS and Microsoft Azure. By the same token many organizations consume cloud 
SaaS resources, most commonly Office 365, SFDC, SAP and Google Apps. The shift 
toward cloud applications causes discrepancy with existing security models, which 
are primarily targeted at establishing security posture for on-premresource. Cloud 
security is becoming an increasingly popular choice for delivering security to the 
traffic going to cloud applications and to Internet resources in general. 
Cisco SD-WAN fabric allows connecting to the two leading cloud security services, 
Zscalerand Cisco Umbrella. Connectivity to Zscaleris achieved by establishing GRE 
tunnels to Zscalerpolicy enforcement nodes in their POPs and by sending traffic 
through the tunnels in accordance with the centrally defined policies on vManage. 
ZscalerGUI provides intuitive interface for setting security parameters, viewing 
activity and reporting on security events. Cisco Umbrella currently operates as DNS 
redirection service where client requests for cloud applications are forwarded 
through direct Internet access on the vEdgerouters toward the Cisco UmbrellyDNS 
servers. In the future Cisco Umbrella will offer POP model in which case vEdgerouters 
will be able to provide directly tunneled service similar to Zscalertoday.

Letsquickly recap the main elements of Cisco SD-WAN architecture. Cisco SD-WAN 
applies the principle of SDN onto the wide area network environment. It consists of 
three distinct architecture tiers, data plane, control plane and management plane. 
Data plan consists of collection of vEgderouters deployed at location where SD-WAN 
fabric extends to. vEdgerouters can be delivered in physical or virtual form factor for 
the utmost deployment flexibility. vSmartcontrollers are the control plane function of 
the Cisco SD-WAN solution. vSmartcontrollers facilitate the process of fabric 
discovery and dissimilation of routing and security context between the vEdge
routers. vSmartcontrollers are also responsible for distributing policies centrally 
defined on vManage. vSmartcontrollers and vEdgerouters run overlay management 
protocol, the OMP, which is a single unified control plane protocol. Once necessary 
routing and security context had been distributed between the vEdgerouters, direct 
secure IPSectunnels get established between the vEdgerouters and application 
traffic can flow through. vBondorchestrator facilitates the functions of controllers
discovery and NAT traversal. vManagesystem provides a single pane of glass for all 
operational tasks performed against the Cisco SD-WAN solution. It allows configuring, 
monitoring and troubleshooting all elements of the fabric. vManageexposes REST 
APIs upon which a graphical user interface is constructed. REST APIs are also available 
for any DevOps or automation.  
99

An optional layer of Analytics is delivered through the vAnalyticstool. vAnalytics
allows deeper insight into utilization trends, capacity projections and application 
quality of experience.  
99

Transport independence is one of the keycorner stones of Cisco SD-WAN solution. 
Leveraging the power of abstraction, Cisco SD-WAN can build secure overlay fabric on 
top of any public or private transport, such as MPLS, Internet, 4G LTE, Satellite, point-
to-point circuits and so on. IPSecencryption is used for the secure overlay fabric. 
Transport locators or TLOCs, represent abstraction layer for defining IPSectunnel 
endpoints. As IP addressing is not deterministic and can change, especially, on DHCP 
enabled broadband circuits, Cisco SD-WAN fabric leverages [system IP, color, 
encapsulation] for defining IPSectunnel termination endpoints. This allows 
independence from individual transport IP addressing. 
TLOCs are advertised as TLOC routes in the OMP messages between the vEdge
routers and the vSmartcontrollers. vSmartcontrollers reflect TLOC reachability 
between the vEdgerouters across the fabric. In the absence of control policies on the 
vSmartcontrollers, all TLOC routes get advertised by the vSmartcontrollers to all 
vEdgerouters. Control policies can be used to block certain TLOC route 
advertisements or modify their attributes before passing them along. Once 
advertised, vEdgerouters can construct direct IPSectunnels between themselves. By 
default vEdgerouters construct a full mesh topology.  
100

As mentioned in the previous slide, by default, each vEdgerouter will attempt to 
establish secure IPSectunnels to all remote vEdgerouters across all available 
transports based on the received TLOC route advertisements from the remote vEdge
routers. In case of a mix of public and private transports, vEdgerouters may or may 
not have cross-transport reachability through a common DMZ. In such case, cross 
transport IPSectunnels will not establish and will be marked down. This is a purely 
cosmetic issue reported on the vManage, as connectivity between sites is still 
accommodated through secure IPSectunnels stretched across the common transport 
(public to public transport and private to private transport IPSectunnels). As color is 
one of TLOC attributes (along with system IP and encapsulation), Cisco SD-WAN fabric 
allows creating a setup where vEdgerouters do not attempt to establish secure IPSec
tunnels with remote TLOCs having a different color than a local TLOC. This is called 
restrict option. With restrict, vEdgerouters will not attempt building secure IPSec
tunnels between private and public transports and as such, vManagewill not report 
any downed connections. 
In case a common DMZ is present between the public and private transports, vEdge
routers will successfully build cross-transport secure IPSectunnels and no restrict is 
required. If common DMZ consists of security inspection devices, such as Firewall,  
101

proper security rules need to be put in place to allow IPSectunnel establishment.  
101

Cisco SD-WAN enables transition from traditional MPLS-only networks to a hybrid 
networks that leverage broadband as a legitimate type of transport. Many of the 
broadband circuits are delivered with network address translation. In case of 4G LTE 
service, NAT is very often performed in the carrier network. In order to successfully 
establish IPSectunnels between the vEdgerouters, Cisco SD-WAN fabric has to 
successfully operate across the NAT boundaries. Lets look at two most common NAT 
types, full cone and symmetric.
vBondorchestrator facilitates NAT traversal. vEdgerouters always reach out to vBond
first and if that traffic passed through a NAT device, vBondis going to learn the public 
(post-NAT) and private (pre-NAT) IP addresses of the vEdgerouter. In our case vBond
is going to notify the vEdge1 router of its own public and private IP addresses, so 
vEdge1 is aware that it’s behind NAT. vEdge1 router is going to communicate this 
information to the vSmartcontrollers leveraging TLOC route attributes in the OMP 
updates. vSmartis going to distribute this information to vEdge2 router.  vEdge2 
router follows the same process, so vEdge1 learns about vEdge2’s public and private 
IP addresses, if vEdge2 is behind NAT, otherwise private and public address will be the 
same. If the NAT device uses full-cone NAT, vEdge1 and vEdge2 will now successfully 
establish direct UDP-encapsulated IPSectunnel using post-NATedIP addresses.  
102

Certain NATs cause difficulties for NAT traversal. Most noticeably, symmetric NAT. 
Symmetric NAT creates new mapping for every outbound initiated connection and 
allows back only traffic from the original packet destination IP and TCP/UDP port. If 
we consider the process we had just outlined, imagine that vEdge1 router is behind 
symmetric NAT. When vEdge1 router reaches out to the vBondit creates NAT 
mapping A in the NAT device it’s connected to, however, symmetric NAT will allow 
only the vBondto communicate back to the vEdgerouter using this mapping. When 
vEdge2 router tries to use the NAT mapping A to establish direct UDP-encapsulated 
IPSectunnel toward vEdge1 router, this traffic will be dropped by the NAT device. To 
resolve this situation, vEdge1 router will also attempt to establish UDP-encapsulated 
IPSecconnection toward vEdge2 router and as long as vEdge2 router is not behind 
symmetric NAT, this connection will be successful. This communication from vEdge1 
router to vEdge2 router creates NAT mapping B in the NAT device vEdge1 router is 
connected to, which will allow vEdge2 router to communicate back. Mission 
accomplished. As you can see, as long as both vEdgerouters are not behind 
symmetric NAT, direct IPSectunnel will be successfully established between the two 
vEdgerouters. 
102

CiscoSD-WAN fabric support numerous methods of mapping application traffic onto 
the available transports. Some of the most common ones are performing per-session 
active-active loadsharingacross multiple transports, per-session active-active 
weighted loadsharingacross multiple transports where certain configured ratios are 
applied for proportional traffic distribution, active/standby for pinning application 
traffic to specific transport with or without failover and SLA based application aware 
routing where the choice of transport is govern by meeting (or not meeting) desired 
loss, latency and jitter characteristics. These forwarding methods are not mutually 
exclusive and can be leveraged all at once, while acting on different types of 
application traffic as defined by 6-tuple matching (including DSCP value) or DPI 
signatures.
Overall SD-WAN fabric can operate as a single-hop fabric where all vEdgerouters are 
interconnected through direct IPSectunnels or as a multihopfabric where vEdge
routers establish connectivity to the SD-WAN core of the network and any 
communication between the vEdgerouters must pass through the SD-WAN core. 
Multihopfabric makes a good fit for a colo based design.  
103

As discussedin other chapters, segmentation is a very powerful tool to address the 
use case behind security zoning, compliance, extranet, guest WiFiand a form of 
multitenancy. At the same time, Cisco SD-WAN fabric’s ability to enforce per-VPN 
topology also plays a key role in delivering application quality of experience by 
providing shortest (and if needed also best performing) path between the endpoints. 
Leveraging the power of control policies, Cisco SD-WAN fabric can construct any 
conceivable per-VPN topology. The most common topologies include the default full 
mesh topology, hub-and-spoke topology, partial or regional mesh topology and a 
point-to-point topology. Each topology caters to the different needs for security and 
application quality of experience. Full mesh topology benefits unified 
communications traffic with direct site to site connectivity, hub-and-spoke topology 
benefits data center bound applications requiring security compliance or auditing, 
partial or regional mesh cater to the use case of regional L4-L7 service insertion and 
lastly point-to-point topology benefits extranet connectivity for partners, suppliers 
and M&As. 
104

Cisco SD-WAN fabric incorporates ground-up security approach for protecting 
infrastructure elements against denial of service attacks and securing communication 
between all fabric elements. Cisco SD-WAN fabric also provides L3, L4 and L7 DPI  
security policy enforcement for the actual application traffic. In some cases, it may 
become necessary to provide statefulFirewall inspection services or augment 
security posture with IDS/IPS functionality. Such security controls can be delivered in 
a fully distributed manner at each location (placed behind the vEdgerouter) or in a 
centralized manner at the main data centers. Each method carries it’s own pros and 
cons. Fully distributed model typically results in higher costs of ownership and more 
complicated operations, while centralized model can introduce latency and cause 
unnecessary wastage of bandwidth resources at the data center (after all, application 
traffic needs to be brought all the way into the main data center only to sometimes 
encounter a deny Firewall rule).
Regionalization of L4-L7 security services by establishing regional secure perimeter 
around protected data center resources offers a compromise between the two 
approaches. Cisco SD-WAN solution is L4-L7 service agnostic, which means any L4-L7 
service of choice can be leveraged, such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS appliances, DLP 
appliances, web proxies and so on. In case of Firewalls that observe trusted and  
105

trusted security zones, they can be connected to the vEdgerouters in the regional 
hub or regional data center facility leveraging multiple links (link per zone). vEdge
router in the regional facility advertises the availability of a local service into the VPN 
of choice. These advertisements are carried through the service routes using OMP. 
After service is advertised, policies are used to steer the traffic of interest to the L4-L7 
service in the VPN of choice. vEdgerouters that receive the actual application traffic 
perform forwarding decision sending the traffic toward the vEdgerouter in the 
regional facility overriding regular fabric routing decision that would have taken this 
traffic toward the vEdgerouter in the data center. At the regional facility, local vEdge
will forward the traffic to the L4-L7 service node for policy enforcement. If the policy 
enforcement ended with allow action, L4-L7 service node routes the traffic back to 
the vEdgerouter, which takes a fabric routing decision sending it toward the vEdge
router in the data center.
Service insertion can be extended to chain several L4-L7 service in the path of an 
application traffic. These services do not have be resident on the same vEdgerouter 
or even be in the same regional facility.  
105

Cisco SD-WAN fabric catersto both unicast and multicast application traffic. vEdge
routers at the remote locations leverage IGMP and PIM messages to learn about the 
existence of interested multicast receivers. This information is carried and distributed 
through the OMP multicast address family updates. Certain vEdgerouters also 
assume the role of traffic replicators. Replication function can be co-resident in the 
data center head-end vEdgerouters for a head-end replication or it can be delivered 
in a regional manner. For PIM spare-mode implementation, which is the most 
common deployment, RP is typically located in the data center network. Just like in 
traditional PIM sparse-mode implementation, RPs are leveraged to establish initial 
multicast stream between the senders and receivers, after which a shortest path tree 
switchover occurs. vEdgerouters acting as replicators, replicate multicast traffic 
across the point-to-point IPSectunnels for delivery to remote locations with 
interested receivers.  
106

Cisco SD-WAN fabric has a very well thought-through approach in regard to delivering 
high availability and redundancy. On the side level, if high availability is desired, two 
vEdgerouters should be deployed. In case of local L2 topology, vEdgerouters can act 
as default gateways for the local hosts. They can run per-VLAN VRRP, effectively 
achieving active/active forwarding. In case of vEdgerouter failure, VRRP standby gets 
promoted to master. It is possible to tune VRRP timers for faster failover times. In 
case of local L3 topology, vEdgerouters establish OSPF or BGP relationship to the site 
router or multiple site routers. If both vEdgerouters advertise same L3 prefix to the 
site router, site router will forward the traffic to both vEdgerouters based on its 
hashing algorithm. In case of vEdgerouter failure, site router will leverage routing 
protocol convergence to forward the traffic to the other vEdgerouter. OSPF and BGP 
timers can be tuned for faster routing convergence. 
Transport redundancy is the ability of Cisco SD-WAN fabric to cope with transport 
failure. There are two model of transport connectivity. The first model depicted on 
the left assumes full-mesh transport connectivity. In this case the failure of the 
transport will result in the bring-down of the IPSectunnels leveraging this transport. 
vEdgerouter will hash the traffic to the remaining IPSectunnels. The second model 
depicted on the right assumes U-shape topology where each vEdgerouter is  
107

connected only to its respective transport. In this case each vEdgerouter builds IPSec
tunnels across its directly connected transport and across the transport connected to 
the neighboring vEdgerouter treating the neighboring vEdgerouter as an underlay 
router. In this case the failure of the transport will also result in the bring-down of the 
IPSectunnels leveraging this transport.
If the failure occurs in the indirectly connected part of the network, such as data 
center headend or carrier core device that results in transport connectivity loss, 
vEdgerouters rely on the synthetic BFD probes for determining tunnel liveliness. In 
case of the transport failure, IPSectunnels leveraging this transport will be torn 
down. BFD probes timers can be tuned down for faster failover.
Lastly, in the unlikely event of all vSmartcontrollers becoming unreachable, vEdge
routers will hold on to their last known good state and maintain established IPSec
tunnels for the desired amount of time, as determined by the configured graceful 
restart timer. Any control plane functions, such as new site bring-up, new route 
advertisement, encryption key rotation and policy distribution will not be available 
until connectivity to at least one vSmartcontroller is regained. Established IPSec
tunnels will remain in tact until the expiration of the graceful timer, which will 
invalidate known remote encryption keys and result in tearing down of the IPSec
tunnels.

fabric

111

vEdgerouters’software includes an embedded deep packet inspection (DPI) engine, 
which is used for application recognition. DPI engine includes over 3,000 applications. 
Application are bundled into application families for easier operation. Once 
application had been identified, vEdgerouters can enforce a variety of behaviors, 
including application firewalling, traffic QoSand prioritization, and transport 
selection. Additionally, application recognition can be used for more meaningful 
analytics or purely for visibility purposes. DPI is an option element. Without DPI 
vEdgerouters rely on 6-tuple (including DSCP) matching, rather than referencing 
applications by name.  
112

One of the cornerstones of Cisco SD-WAN fabric is the ability to detect path quality 
and brownout conditions, so an application aware routing decisions can be taken for 
the application traffic of interest. Each vEdgerouter automatically  initiates path 
quality monitoring over every established IPSectunnel to determine transport 
performance characteristics of loss, latency and jitter. vEdgerouters leverage 
synthetic BFD probes for this purpose. Additionally, BFD probes are also leveraged to 
detect up/down condition and maximum path MTU over each established IPSec
tunnel.
Each vEdgerouter initiates BFD probe every “hello” interval over every established 
IPSectunnel. This interval is 1s by default. Lost BFD packets are counted toward path 
loss, timestamps are used to determine path latency and jitter. An average of loss, 
latency and jitter is calculated for the poll interval. Poll interval is 10minutes by 
default. An average of several poll intervals is considered for a final loss, latency and 
jitter for vEdgerouter to act on. The number of considered poll intervals is the app-
route multiplier, which 6 by default. A quick calculation reveals that default timers 
result in 1h average, which may not satisfy every deployment. All BFD timers are 
tunable to achieve very rapid detection of path brownout conditions. 
113

Many Enterprises are looking to deliver SLAs for the critical applications in their 
environments. Cisco SD-WAN fabric application aware routing allows selecting paths, 
which comply with administratively set SLA thresholds of loss, latency and jitter. In 
the previous slide we discussed how synthetic BFD probes are used to measure path 
performance characteristics over every available transport. Lets consider an example 
where vEdge1 router establishes three IPSectunnels toward vEdge2 router over the 
three available transports. vEdge1 router automatically detects loss, latency and jitter 
characteristics for each path, as depicted. 
An Enterprise is interested to ensure that Application A is forwarded only along the 
paths that satisfy certain SLA conditions. Application aware routing policy is created 
on the vManageand is distributed to the vEdgerouters through the vSmart
controllers using OMP. vEdge1 router evaluates the policy and determines that path2 
does not satisfy the SLA conditions and as such is not eligible to carry application A 
traffic. Path1 and path3 do satisfy the SLA conditions and as such vEdgerouter will 
hash application A traffic on both paths on a per-session basis. Path quality 
measurement process continues all the time (as long the IPSectunnel is up) and 
should path2 conditions improve to the degree that they satisfy application aware 
routing policy SLAs, vEdge1 router will include path2 as eligible to carry application A  
114

traffic. 
114

Applications thatperform file transfers or handle email attachments, can greatly 
benefit from large size packets. Cisco SD-WAN fabric performs automatic maximum 
path MTU discovery for every established IPSectunnel in order to prevent packet 
fragmentation and improve overall application performance. vEdgerouters using 
synthetic BFD probes for that purpose. When TCP SYN packet is received on vEdge
router service (LAN) side, vEdgerouter will modify the MSS option field to reflect the 
largest size packet that can be forwarded through the IPSectunnel without 
fragmentation, so hosts on both sides of the connection can achieve maximum 
throughput without the need to perform packet reassembly (vEdgerouters perform 
fragment-then-encapsulate). It is also possible to manually set the TCP MSS value in 
the vEdgerouter device configuration template under the service (LAN) side interface 
configuration.
For non-TCP traffic, vEdgerouters participate in host path MTU discovery, so when 
vEdgerouter receives large IP packet with DF bit set, it will respond with ICMP 
unreachable, fragmentation needed message back to the sender, specifying the 
maximum MTU before fragmentation occurs. The originating hosts should respond by 
lowering the packet size, effectively preventing fragmentation over the SD-WAN 
fabric.  
115

Delivering solid application experiencewould not have been complete with out 
enforcing QoSbehavior for application traffic as it traverses the vEdgerouter.
Cisco vEdgerouters are capable of rich QoSfeatures to provide differentiated service 
tothe application traffic flowing across. vEdgerouters perform classification function 
on the ingress service (LAN) side interface mapping application traffic into the 
forwarding classes. Traffic classification can be based on 6-tuple (including DSCP) 
marking or a DPI signature. Additionally vEdgerouters can also rewrite the DSCP 
value of the incoming packets if new QoStrust boundary is desired. Forwarding 
classes are then mapped into the queues. vEdgerouters support 7 queues with one 
queue being a strict priority queue (low latency queue, or LLQ). When scheduled for 
transmission through the egress interface, vEdgerouter can control relative 
bandwidth percent allocation for each queue, queueing buffer percent allocation, as 
well as determine drop priority of either tail-drop of random early discard. 
Finally, internal IP packet DSCP markings (modified or original) are copied to the outer 
IP header. This is important for MPLS transport where service provider can enforce 
different class of service behavior based on the received DSCP markings. 
116

Another element of delivering application experience is the ability to mitigate high 
latency, which had adverse impact on the TCP throughput and performance. 
Traditionally, WAN optimization solutions were deployed to facilitate application 
delivery across long-haul high-latency circuits or across the low bandwidth paths. 
WAN optimization appliances achieved that by employing mechanisms around packet 
deduplication, content caching, compression, TCP flow optimization and some 
protocol specific optimizations. With introduction of SD-WAN and the ability to 
incorporate cost effective Internet bandwidth, WAN optimization features such as 
deduplication, content caching and compression are large thing of a past. Protocol 
specific optimization may still have merit, but it hardly justifies a dedicated solution. 
The last piece of a puzzle left on the table is the TCP performance and throughout 
across long-haul high latency circuits. 
Cisco SD-WAN fabric incorporates TCP optimization features to address this specific 
problem. vEdgerouters configured for TCP optimization in a VPN of choice, perform 
local user TCP connection termination and establish optimized TCP connection with 
the remote vEdgerouter. Remote vEdgerouter then establishes connection to the 
eventual destination server. The use of local TCP connections and optimized 
connections between the two vEdgerouters vs a single end-to-end connection  
117

between users and servers, carries the following advantages:
1. vEdgerouters perform local TCP acknowledgements towards sender preventing 
the sender from waiting for end-to-end TCP acknowledgements and pausing the 
transmission in the interim.
2. vEdgerouters perform selective acknowledgements preventing the sender from 
retransmitting TCP segments that were successfully received
3. vEdgesrouters employ better congestion handling algorithm for optimized TCP 
connections between themselves by make more intelligent decisions around TCP 
windowing.
Lastly, hosts leveraging older TCP/IP stacks are likely to see greater benefit from the 
TCP optimization features.  
117

With consumption of cloud SaaS applications on a steep rise, Cisco SD-WAN fabric 
offers embedded network intelligence to provide optimal user experience when 
consuming those application. The set of functionalities addressing optimal cloud SaaS 
applications access is called Cloud onRampfor SaaS. Since SaaS applications mainly 
reside on the Internet, the question of optimal SaaS applications access boils down to 
the challenge of designing best-performing Internet exit point. Lets consider two 
examples. First example is the remote site that had been configured with two direct 
Internet access circuits from two different ISPs. When Cloud onRampfor SaaS is 
configured on the vManage, vEdgerouter at the remote site kicks off the process of 
quality probing for the cloud SaaS application of choice in a VPN of choice. VPN is this 
case signifies the VPN configured on the local vEdgerouter where the cloud SaaS 
application users reside. This probing service “knocks” on the front door of the 
desired cloud SaaS application measuring HTTP connection loss and latency 
characteristics. In this case quality probing is performed over both DIA circuits. Based 
on the resultant measurements, remote site vEdgerouter makes a forwarding 
decision sending cloud SaaS application traffic over the best performing DIA circuit. 
The process of probing continues and should a change in performance characteristics 
of the DIA circuits occur, remote site vEdgerouter will make an appropriate 
forwarding decision.  
118

Second example is the remote site with a single DIA connection and an SD-WAN 
fabric that connects this remote site to the regional hub. Much like the previous case, 
Cloud onRamfor SaaS can be configured on the vManageand become active on the 
remote site vEdgerouter. However, in this case, Cloud onRampfor SaaS also gets 
enabled on the regional hub vEdgerouter. Regional hub vEdgerouter is designated as 
the gateway node. Quality probing service toward the cloud SaaS application of 
interest in a VPN of interest gets kicked off on both the remote site vEdgeand the 
regional hub vEdge. Regional hub vEdgereports it’s HTTP connection loss and latency 
characteristics to the remote site vEdgein the OMP message exchange through the 
vSmartcontrollers. At this moment remote site vEdgerouter can evaluate the 
performance characteristics of its local DIA circuit vs the performance characteristics 
as reported by the reginal hub vEdge(plus the loss and latency incurrent by traversing 
the SD-WAN fabric between the remote site and a hub site) and make an appropriate 
forwarding decision sending application traffic down the best performing path toward 
the cloud SaaS application of choice.
The quality of cloud SaaS application connection is quantified as ViptelaQuality of 
Experience (vQoE) score on the scale of 1 to 10. vQoEcan be observed in the 
vManageGUI. 
118

As many organizations embark on cloud-first journey, the adoption of cloud IaaS 
services is on the raise. AWS and Microsoft Azure are two of the most common IaaS 
services in place at customer environments. Cisco SD-WAN fabric allows two models 
of extending fabric intelligence to AWS and Microsoft Azure IaaS environments. The 
first one is to instantiate vEdgeCloud in each AWS VPC or Microsoft Azure VNET. In 
this case the compute resources are directly attached to the vEdgeCloud instance. As 
mentioned, in this case full range of SD-WAN services get extended right into the 
AWS and Microsoft Azure IaaS environments. This mainly includes multipathing
(leveraging AWS direct connect or Azure Express Route along side with Internet 
connectivity), security, segmentation and QoS. As efficient as this method is, it 
requires deploying vEdgeCloud instance into each existing (or new) VPC or VNET. For 
customers who want to keep their vEdgeCloud deployment at its minimum or for 
customers who do not wish to “touch” their existing VPCs/VNETs, Cisco SD-WAN 
offers a second option. 
With second option, a gateway VPC/VNET can be leveraged to front-end all host 
VPCs/VNETs. A gateway VPC/VNET hosts a pair of redundant vEdgeCloud routers. 
Standards based IPSecconnections are established between the gateway VPC/VNET 
and all the participating host VPCs/VNETs. BGP routing protocol runs on top of these  
119

IPSectunnels to advertise SD-WAN fabric routes to the host VPCs/VNETs and the 
VPC/VNET subnets to the SD-WAN fabric. This option is completely automated 
through the use of vManagewizard (support for Microsoft Azure wizard is upcoming).

This concludes the Cisco SD-WAN Capabilities –ReinventingWAN Application 
Services module. Thank you for watching. 
121

This module will address how Cisco SD-WAN capabilities address the pillar focused on 
reinventing WAN Operations. 
122

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Explain single pane of glass operation of Cisco SD-WAN fabric
• Explain and whiteboard the different tenancy models of Cisco SD-WAN fabric
• Explain application performance and visibility capabilities
• Explain configuration templates and policies operation
• Explain available troubleshooting and verification tools
• Explain and whiteboard the self-healing nature of Cisco SD-WAN fabric 
123

Cisco vManageprovides a single pane of glass into managing, monitoring and 
operating the entire Cisco SD-WAN environment. It is cloud delivered and can be 
hosted from Viptelapublic cloud, managed partner cloud or a private cloud on 
customer premise. vManagecan operate as a single tenant or multi-tenant system. It 
employs role basedaccess control for segregated administrative responsibilities. 
Customer have a choice for using locally defined user data base or connect to central 
user repository leveraging TACACS or RADIUS. For high availability and higher scale, 
vManagesystem can be clustered. Due to database replication, active members of 
the cluster should not have higher latency between themselves than recommended 
by the latest software release notes. Finally, vManageGUI is built upon the REST APIs 
exposed by the vManageserver. These APIs can be used for DevOps, scripting or 
further automation. They can also be used to extract management data into a third 
partyanalysis/monitoring tools. 
124

Multi-tenancy is an important element of service delivery, especially in the service 
provider space, but also in the enterprises that are operationally structured to treat 
internal organization units as tenants.
We can identify three possible forms of tenancy. First is dedicated tenancy where 
each tenant is provided with a fully dedicated control infrastructure. This can be 
viewed as a case of single-tenant solution. Second form of tenancy is VPN tenancy 
where SD-WAN fabric is segmented into VPNs and each VPN represents a tenant. In 
this case, tenants are isolated in the data plane, however all tenants share the same 
control and management plane. Third form of tenancy is an enterprise tenancy where 
vBondorchestrator and a vManageoperate as fully multitenant systems, while 
vSmartcontroller remains dedicated tenant-specific element due to scaling 
considerations. vSmartcontrollers can be deployed as virtual machines or containers 
to help with compute resource requirements. 
125

Ability to quickly deploy branches and remote locations in a highly secure manner is a 
key attribute of the Cisco SD-WAN solution. This is achieved through the zero touch 
provisioning functionality. One can view the ZTP process as consisting of two main 
tasks, what the administrator does and what the installer does. In order to prepare 
for vEdgerouter connection, administrator needs to perform three main activities. 
First, a digitally signed list of vEdgerouters procured by the customer needs to be 
loaded into the vManageby the administrator. This list is obtained from the Viptela
support portal. Second, administrator needs to establish identity trust for the 
certificates installed in the vEdgerouters. These are the same serial numbers that are 
present in the digitally signed vEdgelist. vManagedistributes the digitally signed 
vEdgelist to vSmartcontrollers and vBondorchestrators, so they can accept 
connection from the new vEdgerouter. Third, administrator needs to create device 
configuration template and attach is to the new vEdgerouters. Setup is complete.
Next step is to ship the vEdgerouter to the intended remote location. At the remote 
location, vEdgerouter needs to be connected to power and network. Network 
connectivity can be through a wired or 4G LTE cellular connection and it has to supply 
the vEdgerouter a DHCP IP address. Once IP address is obtained, vEdgerouter 
performs a query toward the cloud ZTP server, which redirect the vEdgerouter to the  
126

appropriate vBondorchestrator, which validates vEdgerouter identity against the 
vEdgewhite-list. vEdgerouter identity gets established by the signed certificate 
inserted into the tempter proof module, the TMP, on board the vEdgerouter at the 
time of manufacturing. It can be seen as a unique fingerprint for every vEdgerouter.
Subsequently vBondorchestrator notifies vEdgerouter of its vSmartcontrollers and 
vManagesystem. vEdgerouter connects to vSmartcontrollers and the vManage
system, and its identity once again gets validated against the white-list. Once 
connected to vManage, vEdgerouter will get configured with the configuration 
template attached by the administrator during the setup phase. Connectivity into 
vSmartcontrollers allows vEdgerouter to exchange control plane information, learn 
reachability and security context and ultimately become part of SD-WAN fabric. 
126

Cisco SD-WAN fabric is fully applicationaware. vEdgerouter software includes a deep 
packet inspection software engine. Once activated, vEdgerouters start understanding 
and categorizing applications flowing through. Application information, as well as the 
traditional flow level information, are exported from the vEdgerouters into the 
vManagesystem for application visibility. vManagealso collects interface and tunnel 
level performance characteristics. Flow information can be exported from each vEdge
router into the external flow collector, DPI level information can be queried through 
REST APIs on the vManage. 
127

Templatesare device configurations attached to the vEdgerouters centrally on the 
vManage. The use of variables allows dramatically reducing the number of required 
templates, while maintaining the flexibility of using device-specific values. Variables 
can be very effective during larger vEdgerouter deployments where the values for 
the variables can be provided in bulk. Once attached, any local configuration changes 
are rejected to prevent malicious activity and configuration drift. Any configuration 
template changes done on vManageare propagated to all vEdgerouters this 
configuration templates is attached to. 
128

Policiesare used to govern different device specific and fabric-wide traffic forwarding 
behaviors. Cisco SD-WAN policy frameworks primarily makes use of three centralized 
policies –control, data and application aware routing. Contriolpolicies are acting on 
the control plane advertisements passing through vSmartcontrollers. Control policies 
are defined on the vManageand they are communicated to the vSmartcontrollers 
over the TLS/DTLS connection using NETCONF. Control policies are enforced on the 
vSmartcontrollers and are not forwarded to the vEdgerouters. Data policies are 
acting on the data plane traffic passing through the vEdgerouter. Data policies are 
defined on the vManage, they are communicated to the vSmartcontrollers over 
TLS/DTLS connection using NETCONF and then from vSmartcontrollers to the vEdge
routers using OMP. Like the data policies, application aware routing policies are 
defined on the vManage, they are communicated to the vSmartcontrollers over 
TLS/DTLS connection using NETCONF and then from vSmartcontrollers to the vEdge
routers using OMP.
Policy scope is defined as the sites the policy is active on. The policy scope can range 
from individual device, to collection of devices, to the entire SD-WAN fabric. 
129

Abilityto troubleshoot is a critical element of any solution. Cisco SD-WAN combines 
the simplicity of operation with full solution transparency. vManageoffers a 
collection of tools to perform troubleshooting against all the element of the SD-WAN 
fabric. Ping and traceroute are the two basic, yet essential tools for data plane 
connectivity verification. Administrator can issue ping or traceroute to the destination 
IP address of choice from any vEdgerouter in the fabric. Administrator can also 
control which VPN ping and traceroute will be run in. Control plane health verification 
allows validating the status of the control connections on the vEdgerouter toward 
the vSmartcontrollers and the vManage. For moderate level troubleshooting, 
administrator can run live queries against the vEdgerouters straight from the 
vManageGUI. Life queries return realtimeinformation extracted from the vEdge
router. For deep advance level troubleshooting all SD-WAN fabric elements come 
with fully features CLI. Administrator can SSH into any SD-WAN fabric element to 
perform CLI level troubleshooting. In case of need, administrator can also access 
Linux shell. 
vManagealso collects alarms and events from the fabric, which can be viewed in 
relevant GUI sections. 
130

Performing remote operations, such as software upgrades and configuration changes, 
always carry certain elements of risk. These risks can be associated with human error 
or a functionality deficiency. Cisco SD-WAN fabric comes with a self-healing 
functionality to specifically address the risks associated with software upgrades and 
vEdgerouter configuration changes. Lets look at software upgrade first. When 
administrator uploads new operating system image into the vEdgerouter and issues a 
reboot, vEdgerouter will attempt to load the new image. If vEdgerouter reconnects 
to the vManage, the upgrade is deemed successful and it is confirmed by the 
vManage. If vEdgerouter does not reconnect to the vManagewithin a certain period 
of time, it will take an independent action of rolling back to the previously running 
software image, at which point it will successfully connect back to the vManage. 
Similarly, if administrator performs configuration change by modifying configuration 
template on the vManage, and if such change results in loss of connectivity to the 
vManage, after certain period of time vEdgerouter will take an independent action of 
rolling back the configuration change and restoring the connectivity.
Self healing functionality on the vEdgerouter safeguards administrative actions of 
software image upgrade and configuration change, and prevents truck-rolls for  
131

remediation.

Thank you for watching. 
133

Up to this point we have discussed the architecture, use cases 
and technology components. In this section we will discuss the 
common network design practices in deployment. 
High Availability and Redundancy :
Viptelacomponents are deployed in redundant Active/Active 
mode. This is true for the control plane and data plane elements 
(vBond, vSmartand vEdges). vManage(NMS system) is 
deployed in a Active/Cold Standby for Disaster Recovery (DR).
Scalability :
Viptelasolution provides a scale out model where the scale of  
134

the solution is not limited by scale limitation of a given element. 
Solution can scale out by adding additional elements. The data, 
control, management scale can be scaled out independent of 
each other. 
134

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Understand that SD-WAN solutionis applicable and is deployed to small, 
medium and large enterprises across all verticals
• Most common designs and deployments are simple
• Ensure you are able to whiteboard different designs at a high level
• Recognize that it makes sense to reach out to a TME until more comprehensive 
documentation is available 
135

Viptelacontrol plane deployment is very flexible and can be deployed in 
public/private cloud hosted by viptela, MSP or On-premby end customer in their DCs. 
Most commonly deployed model is to host controllers in Viptelapublic cloud (AWS). 
For redundancy and HA, two different regions are picked in AWS. 
One set of controllers are deployed in one region and the other set is deployed in the 
other region. vBondand vSmartare deployed in Active/Active mode across the 
regions. 
vManageis deployed as Active in one region and is deployed in a cold standby mode 
in the other region. The backup vManageis manually brought up in DR situation 
where the primary active vManageis down and cannot be recovered.
IP addresses assigned to the interfaces are Private (RFC1918) IP addresses and AWS 
provides 1:1 natedpublic IPs for all the controllers.
Control plane is established across controllers and the remote vEdgeson the public 
Internet.

This model also support data plane connectivity between the vEdgeson other 
transports including MPLS, leased line, metro-ethernet, etc. This means we can 
establish IPSectunnels on other transport even we have control plane on only public 
Internet.
Customer likes the simplicity as VM management of the controllers is done by Viptela
and customer just has to be concerned over overlay network operations. 
136

There are customer wanting to have control plane over more than just internet. They 
want to have transport redundancy for their control plane deployment e.g. they want 
control plane to be setup on Internet and MPLS.
Viptelaoffers a flexible control plane where it could be extended to multiple 
transports as needed.
One of the most commonly deployed design is shown in the diagram above. This 
control plane design is usually hosted by large enterprises in their DCs or by Managed 
Service Providers (MSP) for their end customers.
Same HA/Resiliency principles apply where two DC/Regions are picked in different 
fault domains. A set of controllers are deployed in each.
Public IPs are assigned to the controllers. These IPs are reachable from the internet 
through DMZ/FW within the enterprise or within the MSPs cloud environment.
These public IPs are advertised into the MPLS domain as well. Now the same 
controllers are reachable from the vEdgesin customer locations on MPLS.

Now a given vedgeswill be able to esatblishcontrol connection over the internet 
AND MPLS.
• For Hybrid control plane deploymentsome large enterprises opt for deploying it 
in their own DCs and leak publicly assigned addresses into their MPLS domain
• The same model has been used by the MSPs for their managed services’ 
customers 
137

There are customers where they want transport redundancy forcontrol plane but at 
the same time have to meet security requirements. In many cases we have seen 
security policy doesn’t allow any direct communication to a publicly assigned address 
on MPLS. No communication is allowed on MPLS destined to a public IP through DC.
In this case the controllers are deployesusing Private IPs and are advertised to the 
MPLS transport. Now the controllers are reachable via their private IP over MPLS.
Now traffic destined to internet destination is routed through the DMZ/Security stack 
in the DCs. At the same time the traffic is NATedto a public IP before leaving the DCs. 
Now the controllers are available on MPLS via the private addresses and on the 
internet via Public IPs.
vBondcannot sit behind a PAT but could sit behind 1:1 NAT. vSmartand vManagecan 
sit behind standard NAT. 
Recommendations : Use 1:1 NAT and no PAT for ALL controllers.

Inthe cases where the controllers are accessible via MPLS as well, it is simpler to 
provide access to the DC hosted services to the controllers including TACACS/RADIUS, 
SNMP, Syslog Server, etc.
This is not as easily doable when the controllers are deployed in a public cloud 
including Viptelahosted controllers.
Viptelahas a standard design where the SW vEdgeis deployed along with the 
controllers in the cloud. The vEdgesbeomepart of the overlay and the network 
management interfaces of the controllers are placed in a management VPN on the 
SW vEdge.Thisprovides a secure and dynamic communication between the 
controllers and the services hosted in the DC.
Now one can implement a policy that only users on the corporate network can access 
the controllers and when a user tries to login, they get authentication and 
authorization through the enterprise hosted TACACs/RADIUS. Enterprise has full 
control and visibility on services and users who can access the controllers.

Viptelahas an extensive experience in migrating customers from legacy to SD-WAN.
The most commonly usedmigration strategy includes the following
• Identify the gateway/DC sites that will provide bridge between the SD-WAN sites 
and the Legacy sites
• Deploy the vEdgein the Gateway/DC sites with L3 peering with existing router 
providing connectivity to legacy sites. Run BGP/OSPF to exchange legacy and SD-
WAN routes between them.
• Start replacing the legacy routers in remotes with SD-WAN routers.
• During migration, traffic between the SD-WAN goes direct over hybrid transports 
over IPSectunnels between sites.
• During migration traffic between SD-WAN and Legacy sites is routed through the 
Gateway/DC sites.
• Once the migration is complete, the legacy routers could be removed from the 
gateway/legacy sites.

Viptelasupports wide range of topologies for the site deployments including and can 
terminate multiple transports on a single vEdge. ViptelavEdgerouters support up to 
7 transport interfcaes. 
Single vEdgewith single and multiple transports is supported. 
With multiple vEdgeswe can also support the U shaped topologies where different 
transports can be be present on different vEgdes. Viptelacan support extension of 
transport connections via direct link between them, In such topologies both the 
vEdgeshave access and visbilityon all the transports. This capability is called “Tloc-
Extension”.[top right topology]
Viptelacan also work sitting behind a legacy router or can replace the existing legacy 
CE router.
Standard routing mechanisms are available on the LAN side including VRRP, Static, 
OSPF and BGP.

In this case we have asmall Enterprise customer with less than 100 Sites with two 
Data Centers in a active and backup. The sites are located around the US.
The controllers are hosted in ViptelaCloud.
In the Datacenters they have two MPLS circuits and One broadband circuit. In the 
branches they have one MPLS and one broadband circuit.
They do local-internetexit from the branches as the primary method and fall back to 
datacenter as backup for SaaS applications.
Single VPN Segment is used. Seamless migration from legacy to SD-WAN. 
142

Medium size Enterprise with300+ sites with Global presence with three DCs. 
Controllers are hosted in VipytelaCloud.
Utilizing 6 VPN segments / Business Entities across hybrid WAN. 
Data Centers have Dual MPLS and Dual Broadband connections.

Centralized policies for path selection, 
143

Another Large scale global enterprise deployment. Havingmultiple DCs for North 
America and Regional DCs in Europe and APAC.
Controllers are hosted in ViptelaCloud.
Wide range of access technologies including DSL/Cable/LTE/MPLS. 
Application-Aware and performance based path selection. 
Regional Aggregation and Regional preferences for the DCs.
Multiple VPN Segments. 
144

In this module you learned that:
Viptelacontrollers are flexible and can be deployed in public/private clouds hosted by 
viptela, MSP or by the customer themselves. 
Viptelasolution supports small, medium and large customers with diverse transports 
145

This concludes the SD-WAN High Level Network Design and Deployment Module.

Seeing is believing.It is that time. Everyone has access to the demo platform. You can 
login and follow along, but we encourage you to stay engaged and follow the story 
flow as it is being presented. We will break after this module to provide you with 
adequate time to become comfortable with demo capabilities. When we break you 
will have time to prep with your team and to come up with your version of the story 
based on the provided sample exercise. After prep time, each team will then come up 
to the front of the room to show us how you lead with demo. The rest of us will listen 
in as if we are your customer. 
147

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Know where to go and how to access dCloud Viptela demo 
capabilities
• Stay focused and develop a custom story guide taking into 
consideration the target audience, desired outcome and story to tell 
while demonstrating the Viptela solution capabilities
• Leverage a top down approach rather than a bottoms up approach to 
showcase how Viptela maps to customer discovery output and 
relevant capability requirements 
• Avoid a product or solution focused transfer of information (TOI) 
while demoing
• Showcase additional capabilities when required to address most 
common solution related questions that come up while demoing
• Avoid getting into or staying in the weeds 
148

•Dclouddemo allowsyou to demonstratethe capabilities the solution offers that 
are relevant to the customer. This includes
• Zero-Touch Provisioning and bring up
• Centralized monitoring, application visibility, policy application, path 
selection, troubleshooting, configuration management from a single pane 
of glass
• Application aware routing based on business logic and network 
performance
• Transport Independent/ Hybrid Transports
• Segmentation use cases
• Service Insertion 
• Merger and Acquisitions
• SaaS application optimization
• Regional Exits 
149

In this module you learned that:
• The dCloud Viptela demo is available and readily accessible
• We all have a part to play in contributing to demo innovation and should 
consider the target audience, desired outcome and story that we need to tell 
while leveraging the demo platform
• There is a big difference demoing using a top down vs. bottom up approach
• It is preferred to show more when asked specific questions and not to show 
more or get into the weeds for the sake of showing off what we perceive to be 
important details
• It is possible to answer questions in depth while demoing and to pull oneself out 
of the weeds 
150

This concludes the Demonstration of Capability module. Thank you for watching. 
151

Top Down Network Designnever leads with hardware and backs into logical design 
and requirements. As you have gone 4 Dimensional and executed on the discovery, 
design, demo and defend phases of the engagement, we expect that you are in a 
position to make some solid product and solution recommendations. This module 
will cover the new Catalyst 9K line product line and highlight what hardware and 
software supports Cisco SD-WAN based on overall role in the Fabric. It is important 
not to fall in the trap of leading with product and feature details. Our focus should 
stay on mapping innovation from our solutions to key capability requirements that 
were uncovered during the discovery and design phases of the engagement. Review 
product information in context of how it enhances the overall solution offering.  
152

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Highlight the existing and new products offerings that are supported as part of 
the Cisco SD-WAN solution
• Explain why Cisco SD-WAN is the best choice for the ’New Era of Networking’
• Position the appropriate hardware and software based on Cisco SD-WAN 
component roles and responsibilities 
153

The four core elements of CiscoSD-WAN fabric are Cisco vBond, which operates at 
the orchestration plane, Cisco vSmart, which operates at the control plane, Cisco 
vEdge, which are physical or virtual routers operating at the data plane, and Cisco 
vManage, which operates at the management plane. Each solution element plays a 
role in delivering Cisco SD-WAN fabric grounded in principle of secure elastic 
connectivity, application quality of experience, cloud adoption/delivery and agile 
operations. 
154

Cisco portfolio of physical and virtual vEdgerouters offers foundational platform for 
running Cisco SD-WAN solution. Cisco vEdge100 family offers 100mb of encrypted 
throughput with integrated 4G LTE and WiFi. It fits well smaller branch office 
environments. Cisco vEdge1000 offers 1Gb of encrypted throughput and it fits well 
branch office or campus environments. Cisco vEdge2000 offers 1/10Gb of encrypted 
throughput. It fits well larger campus and data center environments. Cisco vEdge
5000 offers north of 20Gb of encrypted throughput. It fits well even larger campus 
and data center environments. As mentioned, Cisco vEdgerouter can be offered in a 
virtual form factor, in which case it is called vEdgeCloud. vEdgeCloud can be 
delivered on greyboxor whiteboxx86 platform for private cloud (on-prem) 
deployment. It is supported on ESXiand KVM hypervisors . Its performance is derived 
from the amount of allocated resources. vEdgeCloud can also be deployed in public 
cloud environments, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. In that case too, its 
performance is derived from the amount of allocated resources 
155

Lets look a little bit deeper into the characteristics of the Cisco vEdge100 family of 
product. This family consists of the three models, Ethernet only, 4G LTE-only and 4G 
LTE+WiFi. 
156

Letsnow look at the characteristics of the Cisco vEdge1000 and Cisco vEdge2000 
routers. 
157

Finally, lets look at highlevel characteristics of the highest performing router, the 
Cisco vEdge5000 
158

Cisco vEdgeCloud virtual router offers ability to provision Cisco SD-WAN solution in a 
virtualized environment. For on-premisedeployment vEdgeCloud can run on ESXi
and KVM hypervisors and it can be deployed on any x86 server. In this case vEdge
Cloud can act as NFV in a virtual branch. Cisco vEdgeCloud can also be used to extend 
Cisco SD-WAN fabric into the public IaaS environments, such as AWS and Microsoft 
Azure. In this case vEdgeCloud is delivered as a virtual machine instantiated in AWS 
VPC or Microsoft Azure VNET.
Cisco vEdgeCloud throughput is dependent on the amount of allocated resources, 
more specifically the number of vCPUs. Tested performance numbers of Cisco vEdge
Cloud range from hundreds of megabits-per-second to over a gigabit-per-second of 
throughput.  
159

Cisco SD-WAN is a cloud-delivered and cloud-operatedsolution for both public and 
private clouds. When deployed in private cloud, all orchestration, control and 
management elements are deployed in customer’s private data center. ESXiand KVM 
are the two most common and supported hypervisors. vBondorchestrator can be 
deployed as a physical vEdgeappliance or as a vEdgeCloud instance with activated 
vBondprocess. vManageis deployed as a virtual machine. vSmartcontrollers can be 
deployed as either virtual machines or containers. Container deployment is done 
using vContainerimage with docker. Similarly for public cloud deployment, vBond, 
vManageand vSmartare deployed as virtual machines in AWS or Microsoft Azure, 
while vSmartcan also be deployed as a container using vContainerimage.

This concludes the Productsmodule. Thank you for watching. 
162

In this module, we will cover everythingthat is new in the world of EN software and 
licensing and how the Cisco One motion is evolving towards a subscription offer 
creating an entirely new business model for our Company. 
163

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Explain Cisco SD-WAN subscription license model
• Explain feature license tiers
• Explain bandwidth licensing
• Explain Cisco vEdgerouter pricing 
164

Cisco SD-WAN is following very simplepricing model, which includes subscription 
license and a perpetual cost of the CPE equipment. Subscription license terms are 1, 
3 and 5 years and the cost is dependent on the features and bandwidth consumed on 
a per-CPE level.  
165

Lets talk about feature license tiers first. CiscoSD-WAN identifies three feature 
license tiers. Each Cisco vEdgerouter requires one of the three offered feature license 
tiers. All feature tiers include 24x7x365 Cisco TAC support and 8x5xNBD RMA 
support.  
166

Thenext license is a bandwidth license. Bandwidth license is needed to support 
bandwidth consumption requirements on a per Cisco vEdgerouter basis. Bandwidth 
license considers peak bandwidth usage in the 95-th percentile, i.e. customer is 
allowed to burst above the licensed bandwidth for 5% of the time. 
167

The last elementof Cisco SD-WAN cost is the cost is the cost of actual Cisco vEdge
routers.  
168

In this module you learned that:
• Explain Cisco SD-WAN subscription license model
• Explain feature license tiers
• Explain bandwidth licensing
• Explain Cisco vEdgerouter pricing 
169

This concludes the Licensing and Software module. Thank you for watching. 
170

The Caveats module is intended to take you throughsome additional things that you 
need to be aware of to avoid setting the wrong expectations with your customer and 
in order to stay out of trouble. 
171

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Understand SD-WAN Control Plane limits
• Understand high availability limitations for control plane
• Understand vEdge hardware limits
• Understand configuration templates and CLI relationship
• Understand software capability limits
• Understand performance limits 
172

The SD-WANplatform is horizontally scalable. This results in no one component 
becoming a limiter for the network to scale.
It is important to understand the controller capacity limits to understand the number 
of components needed for the network in question.
For<2700 vEdges, vManagecan only run as active –standby.
For >2700 vEdges, Clustered vManageis required.
All vBondsand vSmartsact as active-active end-points in the system. 
173

To handle large scale environments, a vManageneeds to be clustered for the 
purposes of data collection from 2700+ devices and processing events and alerts.
The vManagecluster runs in a single data-center. Various vManagefunctions are 
distributed between the nodes running in the active cluster in order to handle the 
network requirements.
For high availability and disaster recovery scenarios, as part of the design a backup 
cluster needs to be provisioned at the DR site.
It is important to note that a single active cluster does not guarantee DR. The 
interdependencies within the cluster may result in impairment if a vManagefails 
within the cluster, with significant impairment if multiple vManageswithin a cluster 
fail. 
174

Understanding the limitsof throughput and sustained number of tunnels and VPN 
segments on the device is important for sizing the type of device that is deployed at 
the site.
The primary limiter on the platform in terms of number of sites and topology 
constraints is the number of IPSectunnels.
The IPSectunnelscreated by SD-WAN are static. 
They consume resources and run probes even when there is no application traffic. 
This consumes bandwidth and reduces overall scale limits on the end devices.
As a result, large scale full mesh capabilities are not possible on this platform, nor are 
dynamic site-to-site tunnels for direct communication between sites. 
175

In comparison with other SD-WAN vendors, Cisco SD-WAN still relies very heavily on 
CLI. All configurations and policies are converted into equivalentCLI syntax and 
applied in the system.
This may be highlighted by competitors as a lack of maturity in the development of an 
easy to use GUI for all functions. 
176

Highlight to the audiencethat during the course of the sales motions, in situations 
where a device fails to come up, or other issues arise, the vManageplatform is 
insufficient for troubleshooting. You will inevitably have to SSH to the device or 
console to it and use the CLI and the underlying bash shell to work on issues. The 
customer will be exposed to this. Again this may be used by competitors to highlight 
the limitation on the vManageplatform to help resolve issues, and the fact that 
you’re still using CLI. 
177

The vEdgeplatform is a lightweight device and the OS on it is a very small footprint 
Linux based OS.
As a result it has limited features in comparison to the ISR.
The features that it does have with regard to QoS, DPI, WAN opt are also limited in 
the scope of their capabilities. 
178

The main performance caveats to be aware of are in terms of sustained throughput 
and platform consumption.
From a performance aspect, the bandwidth values for the platform are duplex values. 
This is important to remember in environments where customers are trying to use 
the maximum amount of throughput on the device they should not be under the 
impression that a 1G device can deliver unidirectional 1G encrypted throughput.
Enabling the other features in the forwarding plane, related to flow capture, DPI and 
policy constructs further results in reduction of throughput.
With regard to platform consumption, if hosted on premise these become limiters in 
the overall storage of the data collected and the performance of the controllers.
The CPU and Memory requirements for vManageare on the higher side, and with a 
clustered vManagein scale environments results in a very significant virtual appliance 
footprint, each VM of 32 CPU and 64GB RAM.
From the storage perspective, vManageperforms a high number of random I/O 
operations which is why it needs at least 3000 IOPS, which generally is only 
deliverable on SSDs.
These can become hurdles in environments where a customer does not have the  
179

appropriate virtual hardware infrastructure to support these virtual appliances. 
179

In this module you learned to:
• Be aware of the capacity limits of all the SD-WAN components
• Be aware that you may end up in a situation where you have to use the CLI
• Be aware of the features that the SD-WAN platform does not have
• Be aware of the limits of the features that the SD-WAN solution has 
180

This concludes the Caveatsmodule. Thank you for watching.

Multiple stakeholdersacross Market Strategy, Marketing, WW EN Sales and Geo Sales 
have come together to make solution positioning easier. We have gone from bundles 
to offers that include more than product SKUs and that now include other value 
added items such as services vouchers and seeding of equipment. If you have 
performed the proper discovery and engaged in design relevant conversations, 
identifying offerings and innovation that will provide the right level of operational 
impact should be simpler. Ask yourself a very simple question -How will you 
empower your customer to start the journey? 
182

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Master simplified solution, bundle and offer positioning
• Understand how to link discovery and design considerations output and targeted 
use cases to solution positioning 
• Ensure you are able to articulate pieces and parts needed to satisfy solution 
requirements
• Identify insertion points during customer conversation to drive upsell

As you can seefrom this module, our selling approach is shifting from a traditional 
approach focused on selling hardware with heavy upfront costs and differentiated 
speeds and feeds to a new software driven sales approach that allows us to embark 
on a journey with our customers. In this land adopt expand renew motion 
we leverage an OpEXSale with Cisco ONE  subscriptions and EA’s. We lead with use 
cases and outcomes, show the value through demo and prove the value through 
prescriptive limited scope production pilots. Network and Security sales approaches 
no longer build on each other, but need to be integrated to demonstrate greater 
value. In this new era of networking, we are selling software and have to become 
good at selling software.  
211

In this module you learned that:
• There are new solution bundles and offers to simplify the selection of the right 
innovation
• Mapping back to discovery and design considerations output and targeted use 
cases simplifies overall solution positioning 
• Software offers provide the necessary pieces and parts to satisfy solution 
requirements as customers embark on the design and deploy for impact journey
• The software sales motion is a journey and naturally provides insertion points 
during the customer conversation to drive upsell 
212

This concludes the What to Sell module. Thank you for watching. 
213

If you are completingthis training with a group of people, it is time to break outinto 
teams and work through sample team exercises. Let’s explore a few types of 
exercises that stress the importance of detailed planning and preparation. 
214

Uponcompleting this module you should be able to:
• Highlight key takeaways including challenges, desired benefits, impacting trends, 
and requirements that are contained within the sample scenario discovery output
• Develop and execute on the appropriate engagement strategy based on the 
customer audience and desired outcomes
• Identify important information that is lacking within the discovery output 
documentation and determine how would you gather missing information
• Determine the appropriate tools to leverage while engaging (PPT, Whiteboard, 
Solution Demo, ROI Calculator, etc.)
• Execute your engagement strategy as part of a role play while leveraging the 
appropriate tools, expanding discovery and while providing unique insights 
215

The following three slides are takeaway references that provide details regarding 
how one could potentially structure and execute on team exercises while working 
with a group. 
The first exercise is focused on assessing a SE’s understanding of:
- Relevant trends, challenges, benefits and key capabilities
- Challenges and benefits associated with discovery output
- Key design considerations associated with discovery output
- How to align whiteboard and demo strategy to target audience and desired 
outcome
Thisexercise tests the SE’s ability to develop a customer engagement strategy and to 
execute on that strategy when dealing with a technical decision maker or mixed 
customer audience.  
216

The second exercise is similar to the first and leverages a scenario add-on that 
includes a greater deal of technical discovery detail. The exercise is focused on 
assessing a SE’s understanding of:
- Deeper level demo strategy
- Additional design considerations, challenges and opportunities resulting from 
more technically focused discovery output
- How to identify the impact associated with caveats
- How deployment timelines and Cisco solution roadmaps potentially address gaps
- What to sell
Thisexercise tests the SE’s ability to develop a technically focused customer 
engagement strategy and to execute on that strategy when dealing with a network 
engineering, network architecture and IT operations audience.  
217

It is a best practiceto designate someone to act as a facilitator when conducting 
these exercises. This take away reference focuses on some tips for the team exercise 
facilitator. 
218

FacilitatorNotes:
Ifyou are acting as an in room facilitator, bring up online stopwatch and set 
countdown on main display--http://www.online-stopwatch.com/full-screen-
stopwatch/
Ask teams to breakout and scrimmage
While teamsare preparing, all facilitators should be walking around answering 
questions, listening in and providing some pointers. Facilitators should provide 
minimal hand holding as we want to show teams where to look, but not necessarily 
what to see. Let the talent in the field surprise you. 
219

In this module you learned that:
• Practicingis fun and important
• It is critical to perform the proper discovery and to gather and analyze key take-
aways
• Account teams will benefit from creating a strategy based on the customer 
audience and desired outcomes
• There is a big difference between planning a strategy and executing on that 
strategy –Practice is important
• Most of the time there is important information lacking within the discovery 
output documentation requiring that we dig deeper with the customer in certain 
areas
• Different tools provide different value during the engagement process and we 
must choose the right tool for the job  
220

This concludes the Team Exercises module. Thank you for watching. 
221
